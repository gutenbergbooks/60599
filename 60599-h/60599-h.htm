<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Herbert Hoover</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Belgium</span>, after centuries of intermittent
misery and recuperation as the cockpit of
Europe, had with a hundred years of the
peaceful fruition of the intelligence, courage,
thrift, and industry of its people,
emerged as the beehive of the Continent.
Its population of 8,000,000 upon an area
of little less than Maryland was supported
by the importation of raw materials, and
by their manufacture and their exchange
over-seas for two-thirds of the vital
necessities of its daily life.</p>

<p>When in the summer of 1914 the people
were again drawn into the European
maelstrom, 600,000 of them became fugitives
abroad, and the remainder were re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>duced
to the state of a city which, captured
by a hostile army, is in turn besieged
from without. Thus, its boundaries were
a wall of bayonets and a blockading fleet.</p>

<p>Under modern economic conditions, no
importing nation carries more than a few
weeks’ reserve stock of food, depending
as it does upon the daily arrivals of commerce;
and the cessation of this inflow,
together with the destruction and requisition
of their meager stocks, threatened
the Belgians with an even greater catastrophe&mdash;the
loss of their very life.</p>

<p>With the stoppage of the industrial
clock, their workpeople were idle, and destitution
marched day and night into their
slender savings, until to-day three and a
half million people must be helped in
charity.</p>

<p>The Belgians are a self-reliant people
who had sought no favors of the world,
and their first instinct and continuing endeavor
has been to help themselves. Not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>only were all those who had resources insistent
that they should either pay now or
in the future for their food, but far beyond
this, they have insisted upon caring
for their own destitute to the fullest extent
of those remaining resources&mdash;the
charity of the poor toward the poor. They
have themselves set up no cry for benevolence,
but the American Relief Commission
has insisted upon pleading to the
world to help in a burden so far beyond
their ability.</p>

<p>This Commission was created in order
that by agreement with the belligerents
on both sides, a door might be opened in
the wall of steel, through which those who
had resources could re-create the flow of
supplies to themselves; that through the
same channel, the world might come to
the rescue of the destitute, and beyond
this that it could guarantee the guardianship
of these supplies to the sole use of
the people.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the initial moral,
social and economic disorganization of the
country and the necessary restriction on
movement and assembly, it was impossible
for the Belgian people to project within
themselves, without an assisting hand, the
organization for the distribution of food
supplies and the care of the impoverished.
Therefore the Relief Organization has
grown to a great economic engine that
with its collateral agencies monopolizes
the import food supply of a whole people,
controlling directly and indirectly the
largest part of the native products so as
to eliminate all waste and to secure
justice in distribution; and, above all,
it is charged with the care of the destitute.</p>

<p>To visualize truly the mental and
moral currents in the Belgian people during
these two and a half years one must
have lived with them and felt their misery.
Overriding all physical suffering and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>trial is the great cloud of mental depression,
of repression and reserve in every
act and word, a terror that is so real that
it was little wonder to us when in the
course of an investigation in one of the
large cities we found the nursing period
of mothers has been diminished by one-fourth.
Every street corner and every
crossroad is marked by a bayonet, and
every night resounds with the march of
armed men, the mark of national subjection.
Belgium is a little country and the
sound of the guns along a hundred miles
of front strikes the senses hourly, and the
hopes of the people rise and fall with the
rise and fall in tones which follow the
atmospheric changes and the daily rise
and fall of battle. Not only do hope of
deliverance and anxiety for one’s loved
ones fighting on the front vibrate with
every change in volume of sound, but with
every rumor which shivers through the
population. At first the morale of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>whole people was crusht: one saw it in
every face, deadened and drawn by
the whole gamut of emotions that had
exhausted their souls, but slowly, and
largely by the growth of the Relief Organization
and the demand that it has
made upon their exertion and their devotion,
this morale has recovered to a fine
flowering of national spirit and stoical
resolution. The Relief Commission stands
as an encouragement and protection to the
endeavors of the Belgian people themselves
and a shield to their despair. By
degrees an army of 55,000 volunteer
workers on Relief had grown up among
the Belgian and French people, of a perfection
and a patriotism without parallel
in the existence of any country.</p>

<p>To find the finance of a nation’s relief
requiring eighteen million dollars monthly
from economic cycles of exchange, from
subsidies of different governments, from
the world’s public charity; to purchase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>300,000,000 pounds of concentrated foodstuffs
per month of a character appropriate
to individual and class; to secure
and operate a fleet of seventy cargo ships,
to arrange their regular passages through
blockades and war zones; to manage the
reshipment by canal and rail and distribution
to 140 terminals throughout Belgium
and Northern France; to control the milling
of wheat and the making of bread; to
distribute with rigid efficiency and justice
not only bread but milk, soup, potatoes,
fats, rice, beans, corn, soap and other
commodities; to create the machinery of
public feeding in cantines and soup-kitchens;
to supply great clothing establishments;
to give the necessary assurances
that the occupying army receives no
benefit from the food supply; to maintain
checks and balances assuring efficiency
and integrity&mdash;all these things are a
man’s job. To this service the men of
Belgium and Northern France have given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>the most stedfast courage and high intelligence.</p>

<p>Beyond all this, however, is the equally
great and equally important problem&mdash;the
discrimination of the destitute from
those who can pay, the determination of
their individual needs&mdash;a service efficient,
just and tender in its care of the
helpless.</p>

<p>To create a network of hundreds of
cantines for expectant mothers, growing
babies, for orphans and debilitated children;
to provide the machinery for supplemental
meals for the adolescent in the
schools; to organize workrooms and to
provide stations for the distribution of
clothing to the poor; to see that all these
reliefs cover the field, so that none fall by
the wayside; to investigate and counsel
each and every case that no waste or
failure result; to search out and provide
appropriate assistance to those who would
rather die than confess poverty; to direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>these stations, not from committee meetings
after afternoon tea, but by actual
executive labor from early morning till
late at night&mdash;to go far beyond mere direction
by giving themselves to the actual
manual labor of serving the lowly and
helpless; to do it with cheerfulness, sympathy
and tenderness, not to hundreds
but literally to millions, this is woman’s
work.</p>

<p>This service has been given, not by
tens, but by thousands, and it is a
service that in turn has summoned a devotion,
kindliness and tenderness in the
Belgian and French women that has
welded all classes with a spiritual bond
unknown in any people before. It has
implanted in the national heart and the
national character a quality which is in
some measure a compensation for the
calamities through which these people are
passing. The soul of Belgium received a
grievous wound, but the women of Bel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>gium
are staunching the flow&mdash;sustaining
and leading this stricken nation to
greater strength and greater life.</p>

<p>We of the Relief have been proud of
the privilege to place the tools in the
hands of these women, and have watched
their skilful use and their improvement in
method with hourly admiration. We
have believed it to be so great an inspiration
that we have daily wished it could be
pictured by a sympathizing hand, and we
confess to insisting that Mrs. Kellogg
should spend some months with her husband
during his administration of our
Brussels office. She has done more than
record in simple terms passing impressions
of the varied facts of the great
work of these women, for she spent
months in loving sympathy with them.</p>

<p>We offer her little book as our, and
Mrs. Kellogg’s, tribute in admiration of
them and the inspiration which they have
contributed to this whole organization.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>This devotion and this service have now
gone on for nearly 900 long days. Under
unceasing difficulties the tools have been
kept in the hands of these women, and
they have accomplished their task. All of
this time there have stood behind them
our warehouses with from thirty to sixty
days’ supplies in advance, and tragedy
has thus been that distance remote. Our
share and the share of these women has
therefore been a task of prevention, not a
task of remedy. Our task and theirs has
been to maintain the laughter of the children,
not to dry their tears. The pathos
of the long lines of expectant, chattering
mites, each with a ticket of authority
pinned to its chest or held in a grimy fist,
never depresses the mind of childhood.
Nor does fear ever enter their little heads
lest the slender chain of finance, ships
and direction which supports these warehouses
should fail, for has the cantine
ever failed in all these two and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>half years? That the day shall not come
when some Belgian woman amid her tears
must stand before its gate to repeat:
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mes petites, il n’y en a plus</i>,” is simply
a problem of labor and money. In this
America has a duty, and the women of
America a privilege.</p>

<p class="p110 center">THE LEADERS</p>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> story of Belgium will never be
told. That is the word that passes
oftenest between us. No one will
ever by word of mouth or in writing give
it to others in its entirety, or even tell
what he himself has seen and felt. The
longer he stays the more he realizes the
futility of any such attempt, the more he
becomes dumb. It requires a brush and
color beyond our grasp; it must be the
picture of the soul of a nation in travail,
of the lifting of the strong to save the
weak. We may, however, choose certain
angles of vision from which we see,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>thrown into high relief, special aspects of
an inexpressible experience.</p>

<p>One of these particular developments is
the unswerving devotion of the women of
Belgium to all those hurt or broken by
the tragedy within and without her gates.
How fortunate are these women, born to
royal leadership, to have found in their
Queen the leader typifying the highest
ideal of their service, and the actual comrade
in sorrow, working shoulder to
shoulder with them in the hospitals and
kitchens. The battle-lines may separate
her wounded and suffering from theirs,
but they know always that she is there,
doing as they are doing, and more than
they are doing.</p>

<p>Never were sovereigns more loved,
more adored than Albert and Elizabeth.
All through these two years people have
been borne up by the vision of the day of
their return. “But how shall we be able
to stand it?” they say. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>“We shall go mad
with joy!” “We shall not be able to
speak for weeping and shouting!” “We
shall march from the four corners of the
country on foot in a mighty pilgrimage to
Brussels, the King shall know what we
think of him as man and leader!”</p>

<p>When they speak of the Queen all
words are inadequate; they place her first
as woman, as mother, as tender nurse.
They are proud, and with reason, of her
intelligence and sound judgment. Under
her father, a distinguished oculist, she
received a most rigorous education; she
is equipped in brain as well as in heart
for her incalculable responsibilities. I was
told the other day that she dislikes exceedingly
having her photograph as
“nurse” circulate, feeling that people may
think she wishes to be known for her good
works. But whether she wishes it or not,
she is known and will be known throughout
history for her good works&mdash;for her
clear, clean vision of right, her swift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>courage, and her utter devotion to each
and all of her people. Albert and Elizabeth,
A and E, these letters are written
on the heart of Belgium.</p>

<p>If in the United States we have been
too far away to realize in detail what the
work of the Queen has been, we have had
on our own shores the unforgettable example
of her dear friend, Marie de Page,
to prove to us the heroism of the women
of Belgium.</p>

<p>Before she came, we knew of her. After
the first two months of the war she had
left her mother and father and youngest
boy in Brussels&mdash;realizing that she was
cutting herself off from all news of them&mdash;to
follow her husband, who had himself
followed his King to Le Havre. She
worked her way across the frontier to
Flushing, and finally to La Panne. The
whole career of Doctor de Page had been
founded on her devoted cooperation, and
one has imagined the joy of that reunion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>in the great base hospital at La Panne,
where he was in charge. Her eldest son
was already in the trenches, the second,
seventeen years old, was waiting his turn.</p>

<p>She worked as a nurse at her husband’s
side, day and night, until she could no
longer bear to see the increasing needs of
the wounded without being able to relieve
them, and she determined to seek aid in
America. This journey, even in peace
time, is a much more formidable undertaking
for an European than for an
American woman, but Marie de Page
started alone, encouraged always by her
good friend, the Queen. And how swiftly,
how enduringly, she won our hearts, as
from New York to San Francisco she told
so simply and poignantly her country’s
story!</p>

<p>She was a Belgian woman; so, even in
her great trouble, she could not neglect
her personal appearance, and after the
fatiguing journey across the Continent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>she looked fresh and charming as we met
her in San Francisco. The first day at
luncheon we were plying her with questions,
until finally she laughed and said,
“If you don’t mind, I had better spread
the map on the table&mdash;then you will see
more quickly all the answers!” We
moved our plates while she took the precious
plan from her bag, and smoothed
it across her end of the table. Then with
her pencil she marked off with a heavy
line the little part that is still free Belgium:
she drew a star in front of La
Panne Hospital and we were orientated!
From point to point her pencil traveled
as we put our eager questions. We marveled
at the directness with which she
brought her country and her people before
us. We knew that her own son was
in the trenches, but she made it impossible
for us to think of herself.</p>

<p>Then, tho there was much more to be
done in America, she left. She must re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>turn
to La Panne; her husband needed
her. She had just received word that her
seventeen-year-old son was to join his
brother in the trenches; she hurried to
New York. She did not wish to book
on a non-neutral line, but further word
showed her that her only chance to see
her boy lay in taking the fastest possible
ship. Fortunately the biggest, safest one
was just about to leave, so she carried on
board the money and supplies she was
taking back to her people.</p>

<p>We settled down to doing what we
could to carry forward her work. Then,
on May 7, 1915, flashed the incredible,
the terrible news&mdash;the greatest passenger
liner afloat had been torpedoed! The
Lusitania had sunk in twenty-two minutes,
1,198 lives had been lost. We went
about dazed.</p>

<p>One by one the recovered bodies were
identified, and among them was that of
Marie de Page.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>We have found some little consolation
in endowing beds in her memory in the
hospital for which she gave her life. She
is buried in the sand dunes not far from
it; whenever Doctor de Page looks from
his window, he looks on her grave.</p>

<p class="space-above"></p>
<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">In</span>”</p>

<p>As the only American woman member
of the Commission for Relief I was permitted
to enter Belgium in July, 1916.</p>

<p>I already knew that this country held
3,000,000 destitute; that over one and one-quarter
million depended for existence entirely
on the daily “soupes”; that between
the soup-lines and the rich (who in every
country, in every catastrophe, can most
easily save themselves) there were those
who, after having all their lives earned a
comfortable living, now found their
sources of income vanished, and literally
faced starvation. For this large body,
drawn from the industrial, commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>and professional classes, from the nobility
itself, the suffering was most acute,
most difficult to discover and relieve.</p>

<p>I knew that at the beginning of the
war the great organizing genius of Herbert
Hoover had seized the apparently
unsolvable problem of the <em>Relief of Belgium</em>,
and with an incredible swiftness
had forced the cooperation of the world
in the saving of this people who had not
counted the cost of defending their honor.
That because of this, every day in the
month, ships, desperately difficult to secure,
were pushing across the oceans with
their cargoes of wheat and rice and bacon,
to be rushed from Rotterdam through the
canals to the C. R. B. warehouses throughout
Belgium. It meant the finding of
millions of money&mdash;$250,000,000 to date&mdash;begging
of individuals, praying to governments,
the pressing of all the world to
service.</p>

<p>I realized, too, that the Belgian men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>under the active leadership of Messieurs
Solvay, Francqui, de Wouters and
Janssen, with a joint administration of
Americans and Belgians, were organized
into the Comit&eacute; National, whose activities
covered every square foot of the country,
determining the exact situation, the exact
need of each section, and who were responsible
for the meeting of the situation
locally and as a whole.</p>

<p>But I knew from the lips of the Chairman
of the C. R. B. himself, that despite
all the work of the splendid men of these
organizations, the martyrdom of Belgium
was being prevented by its women. I
was to learn in what glorious manner, in
what hitherto undreamed of degree, this
was true&mdash;that the women of Belgium,
true to the womanhood and motherhood
of all ages, were binding the wounds and
healing the soul of their country!</p>

<p class="p110 center">THE “SOUPES”</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">I shall</span> never think of Belgium
without seeing endless processions of
silent men and black-shawled women,
pitchers in hand, waiting, waiting for the
day’s pint of soup. One and one-quarter
million make a long procession. If you
have imagined it in the sunshine, think
of it in the rain!</p>

<p>One may shut himself up in his house and forget the war for a few
hours, but he dare not venture outside. If he does he will quickly
stumble against a part of this line, or on hundreds of little children
guarding their precious cards as they wait to be passed in to one of
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfants D&eacute;biles</span>”
dining-rooms, or on a very long line of women in front of a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>communal
store where “identity cards” permit the purchase every week of limited
rations of American bacon or rice and a few other foods at fixt prices
(prices set by American efficiency below those of America itself); or
on a group of black-shawled mothers waiting for the dinner that enables
them to nurse the babies in their arms.</p>

<p>The destitute must have a “supplement”
to their daily ration of carbohydrates
and fat which will give them
protein&mdash;says the C. R. B., and thus we
have “Soupes”;&mdash;but these dry statements
of engineers now become dieticians
convey to no one the human story of
these dumb, waiting lines.</p>

<p>We can have little conception of what
it means for just one city, the Agglomeration
of Brussels, for instance, to keep
200,000 out of its 1,000,000 people on
the “Soupes,” not for a month or two,
but for over two years! Nor does this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>include the soup made by the “Little
Bees,” an organization which cares especially
for children, for the thousands in
their cantines; or the soup served to the
8,500 children in sixty communal schools
of central Brussels at four o’clock each
afternoon, which is prepared in a special
kitchen. These quantities are all over and
above the regular soup served to 200,000&mdash;and
do not think of soup as an American
knows it, think more of a kind of
stew; for it is thick, and, in the words of
the C. R. B., “full of calories.”</p>

<p>To make it for central Brussels the
slaughter-house has been converted into
a mighty kitchen, in charge of a famous
pre-war ma&icirc;tre d’h&ocirc;tel. Ninety-five cooks
and assistants from the best restaurants
of the capital have been transferred from
the making of p&acirc;t&eacute;s and souffl&eacute;s to the
daily preparation of 25,000 quarts of
soup! And they use the ingenuity born
of long experience, to secure an appetiz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>ing
variety while strictly following the
orders of directing physicians. They had
been doing this over 700 days when I
visited the kitchen, but there was still a
fresh eagerness to produce something
savory and different. And one must remember
that the changes can come only
from shifting the emphasis from our dried
American peas to beans, from carrots to
cabbages, from macaroni to rice. The
quantity of meat remains about the same,
1,200 pounds a day, which, tho the committee
kills its own cattle, costs almost
fifty cents a pound. There must be, too,
10,000 pounds of potatoes. The great
fear has been that this quantity might be
cut, and unfortunately, in November,
1916, that fear was realized to the extent
of a 2,000 pound drop&mdash;and then remedied
by the C. R. B. with more beans, more
rice, more peas!</p>

<p>Personal inspection of this marvelous
kitchen is the only thing that could give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>an idea of its extraordinary cleanliness.
The building offers great space, plenty of
air and light and unlimited supply of
water. The potato rooms, where each
potato is put through two peeling processes,
are in one quarter. Near them
are the green vegetable rooms with their
stone troughs, where everything is washed
four or five times. The problem of purchasing
the vegetables is so great that a
special committee has been formed at
Malines to buy for Brussels on the spot.
One of the saving things for Belgium has
been that she produces quantities of these
delicious greens. In the smaller towns a
committeeman usually goes each morning
to market the day’s supply. For instance,
the lawyer who occupies himself with the
vegetables for the Charleroi soup, makes
his own selection at four o’clock each
morning, and is extravagantly proud of
the quality of his carrots and lettuces!
The most important section, naturally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>is that which cares for the meat and unsmoked
bacon or “lard” the C. R. B.
brings in. The more fat in the soup, the
happier the recipient! With the little meat
that can still be had in the butcher shop,
selling at over one dollar a pound, one can
imagine what it means to find a few pieces
in the pint of soup! Then there is the
great kitchen proper, with the one hundred
and forty gas-heated caldrons, and
the dozens of cooks hurrying from one
to another. There seem to be running
rivers of water everywhere, a perpetual
washing of food and receptacles and
premises.</p>

<p>The first shift of cooks arrives at two-thirty
in the morning to start the gas
under the one hundred and forty great
kettles, for an early truck-load of cans
must be off at 8 o’clock. That shift leaves
at noon; the second works from 8 till 5,
on an average wage of four francs a day
and <em>soupe</em>!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>There are ten of the large trucks and
500 of the fifty-quart cans in constant
use. As soon as the 8 o’clock lot come
back, they are quickly cleaned, refilled,
and hurried off on their second journey.
Mostly they are hurried off through rain,
for there are many more rainy than sunny
days in Belgium.</p>

<p>One passes a long line of patient, wet,
miserable-looking men and women with
their empty pitchers, then meets with a
thrill the red truck bringing the steaming
cans. The bakers have probably
already delivered the 25,000 loaves of
bread, for a half loaf goes with each
pint of soup.</p>

<p>By following one of these steaming
trucks I discovered “Soupe 18,” with its
line of silent hundreds stretching along
the wet street.</p>

<p>I was half an hour early, so there was
time to talk with the local committee managers
who were preparing the big hall for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>the women who would arrive in a few
minutes to fill the pitchers with soup, and
the string bags with bread. These communal
soupes are generally directed by
men, tho women do the actual serving.
The enthusiastic secretary, who had been
a tailor before the war, said regretfully
that he had been obliged to be absent
three days in the two years.</p>

<p>At the left, near the entrance, I was
shown the office with all the records, and
with the shelves of precious pots of jam
and tiny packages of coffee and rice
which are given out two or three times a
month&mdash;in an attempt to make a little
break in the monotony of the continual
soup. No one can picture the heartbreaking
eagerness in the faces of these
thousands as they line up for this special
distribution&mdash;these meager spoonfuls of
jam, or handfuls of chopped meat.</p>

<p>We reviewed the army of cans stationed
toward the rear, and the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>bread-racks of either side. The committee
of women arrived; we tasted the soup
and found it good. I was asked to sit at
the table with two men directors, where
I might watch them stamp and approve
the ration-cards as the hungry passed in.</p>

<p>One may hate war, but never as it
should be hated until he has visited the
communal soupes and the homes represented
by the lines. The work must be
so carefully systematized that there is
only time for a word or two as they pass
the table. But that word is enough to reveal
the tragedy! There are sometimes
the undeserving, but it is not often that
any of the thousands who file by are not
in pitiful straits. That morning the saddest
were the very old&mdash;for them the
men had always a kindly “How is it,
mother? How goes it, father?”</p>

<p>The “Merci, Monsieur, merci beaucoup,”
of one sweet-faced old woman was
so evidently the expression of genuine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>feeling, that I asked about her. She had
three sons, who had supported her well&mdash;all
three were in the trenches. Another
still older, said, “Thank you very much,”
in familiar English. She, too, had been
caught in the net, and there was no work.
A little Spanish woman had lost her husband
soon after the war began, and the
director who investigated the case was
convinced that he had died of hunger.
An old French soldier on a crutch, but
not too feeble to bow low as he said
“Merci,” was an unforgettable figure.</p>

<p>Some of the very old and very weak
are given supplementary tickets which
entitle them to small portions of white
bread, more adapted to their needs than
the stern war bread of the C. R. B.;
and every two days mothers are allowed
additional bread for their children. One
curly-haired little girl was following her
mother and grandmother, and slipt out
of the line to offer a tiny hand. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>came a tall, distinguished-looking man,
about whom the directors knew little&mdash;except
that he was absolutely without
funds. They put kindly questions to the
poor hunchback, who had just returned to
the line from the hospital, and congratulated
the pretty girl of fifteen, who had
won all the term’s prizes in the communal
school. There were those who
had never succeeded; then there were
those who two years before had been
comfortable&mdash;railway employees, artists,
men and women, young and old, in endless
procession, a large proportion in
carpet slippers, or other substitutes for
leather shoes. Many were weak and ill-looking;
all wore the stamp of war.
Every day they must come for the pint
of soup and the bread that meant life&mdash;200,000
in Brussels alone; in Belgium
one and a half million! These are the
lowest in the scale of misery&mdash;those who
“must have a supplement of protein,” for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>meat never passes their lips but in soup.</p>

<p>The questions were always swift, admitting
no delay in the reply, and knowing
the hearts of the questioners, I wondered
a little at this. Till in a flash I
saw: if the directors wished to know
more they would go to the homes represented&mdash;but
the line must not be held
back! Every ten minutes’ halt means
that those outside in the rain must stand
ten minutes longer. On this particular
day the committee put through a line representing
2,500 pints of soup and portions
of bread in fifty minutes, an almost
incredible efficiency, especially when you
remember that every card is examined
and stamped as well as every pitiful
pitcher and string bag filled.</p>

<p>That day a woman who had not before
served on the soupes offered her
services to the seasoned workers. They
were grateful, but smilingly advised her
to go home, fill her bath tub with water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>and ladle it out&mdash;to repeat this the following
day and the following, until finally
she might return, ready to endure the
work, and above all, not to retard the
“Line” five unnecessary minutes! Two
and a half years have not dulled the tenderness
of these women toward the
wretched ones they serve.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">At Home</span></p>

<p>Belgium is small. Until now I had
been able to go and return in the same
day. But on this particular evening I
found myself too far south to get back.
I was in a thickly forested, sparsely settled
district, but I knew that farther on there
was a great ch&acirc;teau belonging to the
family of A., with numerous spare rooms.</p>

<p>Tho I had been in Belgium only a
short time I had already learned how unmeasured
is the friendship offered us, but
I also knew that Belgian etiquette and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>convention were extremely rigorous, and
I hesitated.</p>

<p>It was thoroughly dark, when, after
crossing a final stretch of beechwood, I
rang the bell and sent in my card, with
a brief line.</p>

<p>After what seemed an endless time I
saw the servant coming back through the
great hall, followed by three women, who,
I felt instinctively, had not come in welcome.</p>

<p>But there was no turning about possible
now&mdash;some one was already speaking to
me. Her very first words showed she
could not in the least have understood.
And I swiftly realized this was not surprizing
since I had been there so short a
time, and there had not before been a
woman delegate. I explained that my
sole excuse for sending in my stranger’s
card at that time of night was my membership
in the C. R. B.&mdash;and I uncovered
my pin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>It was as if I had revealed a magic
symbol&mdash;the door swung wide! They
took my hands and drew me inside, overwhelming
me with apologies, with entreaties
to stop with them, to stay for a
week, or longer. They would send for
my husband&mdash;as Director he must be
sorely in need of a few days’ rest&mdash;we
should both rest. Their district in the
forest had many relief centers, they would
see that I got to them all. A room was
all ready for me on the floor above&mdash;if I
did not like it I should have another. I
must have some hot tilleul at once!</p>

<p>In the drawing-room I was presented
to the other thirteen or fourteen members
of the family, and in pages I could
not recount their beautiful efforts, individually
and together, to make me forget
I had had to wait for one moment on
their threshold.</p>

<p>Still later, two American men arrived.
They were known, and expected at any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>hour of the day or night their duties
might bring them that way. One of them
was ill, and not his own mother and sister
could have been more solicitous in their
care of him than were these kind women.</p>

<p>Do Americans wonder that it hurts us,
when we return, to have people praise
us for what we have given Belgium? In
our hearts we are remembering what
Belgium has given us.</p>

<p class="p110 center">THE CRADLES ON THE MEUSE</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Dinant</span> made me think of Pompeii.
It had been one of the pleasure-spots
of Belgium; gay, smiling, it
stretched along the tranquil Meuse, at
the base of granite bluffs and beech-covered
hill-slopes. There were factories,
it is true, at either end of the
town; but they had not marred it. Every
year thousands of visitors, chiefly English
and Germans, had stopt there to forget
life’s grimness. Dinant could make
one forget: she was joyous, lovable,
laughing. Before the tragedy of her
ruins, one felt exactly as if a happy child
had been crusht or mutilated.</p>

<p>I came to Dinant in September, 1916,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>by the way of one of the two cemeteries
where her 600, shot in August, 1914,
are buried. This burial-ground is on a
sunny hill-slope overlooking rolling wheat
fields, and the martyred lie in long rows
at the upper corner. A few have been
interred in their family plots, but mostly
they are gathered in this separate place.</p>

<p>Up and down I followed the narrow
paths; the crowded plain white crosses
with their laconic inscriptions spoke as
no historian ever will. “Father, Husband,
and Son”; “Brother and Nephew”;
“Husband and Sons, one seventeen, and
another nineteen”; “Brother and Father”;
“Husband and Brother”; “Brother, Sons
and Father”; “Father and Son”&mdash;the
dirge of the desolation of wives and
sisters and mothers! War that had left
them the flame-scarred skeletons of their
homes, had left them the corpses of their
loved ones as well!</p>

<p>Dinant was not entirely destroyed, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>a great part of it was. A few days after
the burning, people began to crawl back.
They came from hiding-places in the
hills, from near-by villages, from up and
down the river, to take up life where they
had left it. Human beings are most
extraordinarily adaptable: people were
asked where they were living; no one
could answer exactly, but all knew that
they were living somewhere, somehow&mdash;in
the sheltered corner of a ruined room,
perhaps in a cave, or beside a chimney!
The relief committee hurried in food and
clothing, hastily constructed a few temporary
cottages; a few persons began to
rebuild their original homes, and life
went on.</p>

<p>I was walking through a particularly
devastated section, nothing but skeleton
fa&ccedil;ades and ragged walls in sight, when
suddenly from the midst of the devastation
I heard the merry laughter of children.
I pushed ahead to look around the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>other side of a wall, and there was a most
incredible picture. In front of a low temporary
building tucked in among the ruins,
was a series of railed-in pens for children
to play in. And there they were romping
riotously&mdash;fifty-two golden-haired, lovely
babies, all under four! Along the front
of the enclosure was a series of tall poles
carrying gaily painted cocks and cats and
lions. That is the Belgian touch; no relief
center is too discouraging to be at
once transformed into something cheering,
even beautiful. The babies had on
bright pink-and-white checked aprons. I
let myself in, and they dashed for me,
pulling my coat, hiding in the folds of my
skirt, deciding at once that I was a good
horse.</p>

<p>Then happened a horrible thing. One
of the tiniest, with blue eyes and golden
curls, ran over to me laughing and calling,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame, mon p&egrave;re est mort!</span>”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>“Madame, my father is dead, my father is
dead, he was shot!” I covered my ears
with my hands, then snatched her up and
silenced her. There were others ready
to call the same thing, but the nurses
stopt them.</p>

<p>The little ones went on with their romping
while I passed inside to see the equipment
for caring for them. In a good-sized,
airy room were long rows of white
cradles, one for each child, with his or
her name and age written on a white card
at the top. After their play and their
dinner they were put to sleep in these
fresh cradles.</p>

<p>They were brought by their mothers or
friends before seven in the morning, to
be taken care of until seven at night.
They were bathed, their clothing was
changed to a sort of simple uniform, and
then they were turned loose outside to
play, or to be amused in various ways by
the faithful nurses. They were weighed
regularly, examined by a physician, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>daily given the nourishing food provided
by the relief committee. In fact, they
had the splendid care common to the
1,900 cr&egrave;ches or children’s shelters in
Belgium. But this cr&egrave;che was alone in
its strange, tragic setting.</p>

<p>In the midst of utter ruin are swung
the white cradles. In front of them, under
the guardianship of gay cocks and
lions, golden-haired babies are laughing
and romping. Further on more ruins,
desolation, silence!</p>

<p class="p110 center">“THE LITTLE BEES”</p>


<p class="p110 center"><abbr title="1">I</abbr></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Madame</span> ... has charge of a
Cantine for Enfants D&eacute;biles (children
below normal health) in
one of the crowded quarters of Brussels.
These cantines are dining-rooms where
little ones come from the schools at
eleven each morning for a nourishing
meal. They form the chief department
of the work of the “Little Bees,” a society
which is taking care of practically all the
children, babies and older ones, in this
city, who are in one way or another victims
of the war. And in July, 1916, they
numbered about 25,000.</p>

<p>The cantines have been opened in every
section of the city, in a vacant shop, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>cellar, a private home, a garage, a convent&mdash;in
any available, usable place. But
no matter how inconvenient the building,
skilful women transform it at once into
something clean and cheery. In the whole
of Belgium I have never seen a run-down
or dirty relief center. In some the
kitchen is simply a screened-off corner of
the dining-room, in others it is a separate
and excellently equipped quarter. I
visited one crowded cantine where every
day the women had to carry up and down
a narrow ladder stairway all the plates
and food for over 470 children. But they
have so long ago ceased to think in terms
of “tiredness,” that they are troubled by
the question suggesting it. And these
are the women who have been for over
nine hundred days now&mdash;shoulder to
shoulder with the men&mdash;ladling out one
and one-quarter million pints of soup, and
cooking for, and scrubbing for, and yearning
over, hundreds of thousands of more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>helpless women and children, while caring
always for their own families at home.
If after a long walk to the cantine (they
have neither motors nor bicycles) madame
finds there are not enough carrots for the
stew, she can not telephone&mdash;she must go
to fetch whatever ingredient she wants!
Each cantine has its own pantry or shop
with its precious stores of rice, beans,
sugar, macaroni, bacon and other foodstuffs
of the C. R. B., and in addition
the fresh vegetables, potatoes, eggs and
meat it solicits or buys with the money
gathered from door to door, the gift of
the suffering to the suffering.</p>

<p>The weekly menus are a triumph of
ingenuity; they prove what variety can
be had in apparent uniformity! They are
all based on scientific analysis of food values,
and follow strictly physicians’ instructions.
One day there are more grammes
of potatoes, another more grammes
of macaroni in the stew; one noon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>there is rice for dessert, the next phosphatine
and now a hygienic biscuit&mdash;a
thick, wholesome one&mdash;as big as our
American cracker.</p>

<p>It was raining as I entered the large,
modern tenement building which Madame
had been fortunate enough to secure. I
found on one side a group of mothers
waiting for food to take home to their
babies, and on the other the little office
through which every child had to pass to
have his ticket stamped before he could
go upstairs to his dinner. This examining
and stamping of cards by the thousand,
day after day, is in itself a most
arduous piece of work, but women accomplish
it cheerfully.</p>

  <p class="caption">READY FOR THE CHILDREN</p>
  <p class="center">A “Little Bees” cantine for sub-normal children</p>
 </div>

<p>On the second floor, between two large
connecting rooms, I found Madame, in
white, superintending the day’s preparation
of the tables for 1,662. That was
the size of her family! Fourteen young
women, with bees embroidered in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Belgian colors on their white caps, were
flying to and fro from the kitchen to the
long counters in the hallway piled with
plates, then to the shelves against the
walls of the dining-room, where they deposited
their hundreds of slices of bread
and saucers for dessert. Some were
hurrying the soup plates and the 1,662
white bowls along the tables, while others
poured milk or went on with the bread-cutting.
Several women were perspiring
in the kitchens and vegetable rooms. The
potato-peeling machine, the last proud
acquisition which was saving them untold
labor, had turned out the day’s kilos
of potatoes, which were already cooked
with meat, carrots and green vegetables
into a thick, savory stew. The big fifty-quart
cans were being filled to be carried
to the dining-room; the rice dessert was
getting its final stirring. Madame was
darting about, watching every detail, assisting
in every department.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>It was raining outside, but all was
white, and clean, and inviting within.
Suddenly there was a rush of feet in the
courtyard below. I looked out the window:
in the rain 1,662 children, between
three and fourteen years, mothers often
leading the smaller ones&mdash;not an umbrella
or rubber among them&mdash;were lining up
with their cards, eager to be passed by
the sergeant. These kind-hearted, long-suffering
sergeants kept this wavering
line in place, as the children noisily
climbed the long stairway&mdash;calling, pushing.
One little girl stept out to put fresh
flowers before the bust of the Queen.
Boys and girls under six crowded into
the first of the large, airy rooms, older
girls into the second, while the bigger
boys climbed to the floor above. With
much chattering and shuffling of sabots
they slid along the low benches to their
places at the long, narrow tables. The
women hurried between the wiggling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>rows, ladling out the hot, thick soup. The
air was filled with cries of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beaucoup,
Mademoiselle, beaucoup!</span>” A few even
said “Only a little, Mademoiselle.” Everybody
said something. One tiny, golden-haired
thing pleaded: “You know I like
the little pieces of meat best.” In no time
they discovered that I was new, and tried
slyly to induce me to give them extra
slices of bread, or bowls of milk.</p>

<p>In this multitude each was clamoring
for individual attention, and for the most
part getting it. Very little ones were
being helped to feed themselves; second
portions of soup were often given if
asked for. Madame seemed to be everywhere
at once, lifting one after another
in her arms to get a better look at eyes
or glands. Her husband, a physician of
international reputation, was in the little
clinic at the end of the hall, weighing and
examining those whose turn it was to go
to him that day. Later he came out and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>passed up and down the rows to get an
impression of the general condition of
this extraordinary family. When for a
moment husband and wife stood together
in the middle of the vast room, they
seemed with infinite solicitude to be
gathering all the 1,662 in their arms&mdash;their
own boy is at the front. And all
the time the 1,662 were rapidly devouring
their bread and soup.</p>

<p>Then began the cries of “Dessert,
Mademoiselle, dessert!” Tired arms carried
the 1,662 soup plates to the kitchen,
ladled out 1,662 portions of rice, and set
them before eager rows. Such a final
scraping of spoons, such fascinating play
of voice and gesture&mdash;then the last crumb
eaten, they crowded up to offer sticky
hands with “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, Mademoiselle</span>” and
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir.</span>” The clatter of sabots and
laughter died away through the courtyard,
and the hundreds started back to
school.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>The strong American physician, who
had helped ladle the soup, tried to swing
his arm back into position. I looked at
the women who had been doing this practically
every day for seven hundred days.
Madame was apparently not thinking of
resting&mdash;only of the next day’s ration.</p>

<p>I discovered later that at four o’clock
that afternoon she had charge of a cantine
for four hundred mothers and their
new babies, and that after that she visited
the family of a little boy who was absent,
according to the children, because his
shirt was being washed.</p>

<p>All attempts to express admiration of
this beautiful devotion are interrupted by
the cry, “Oh, but it is you&mdash;it is America
that is doing the astonishing thing&mdash;we
<em>must</em> give ourselves, but you need not.
Your gift to us is the finest expression
of sympathy the world has known.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p class="p110 center"><abbr title="2">II</abbr></p>

<p>Before Madame ... was made director
of the cantine for 1,662, she had charge
of one in a still poorer quarter of the
city. I went to look for it on Assumption
Day, the day of the Ascent of the Blessed
Virgin. I knew the street, and as usual,
the waiting line of children in front told
the number. Scrubbed cheeks, occasional
ribbon bows and cheap embroidery
flounces showed the attempt of even these
very poor mothers to celebrate their f&ecirc;te
day. Throughout the city, those fortunate
enough to be called Mary were
being presented with flowers, which since
the war have been sold at extremely low
prices, for the flowers still grow for Belgium,
who supplied the markets of
Europe before she was besieged.</p>

<p>From early morning we had seen old
and young carrying great sheaves of
phlox and roses, or pots of hortensia, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>some favorite Mary. But these little
ones had no flowers, yet they were
gay, as Belgian children invariably
are&mdash;always ready with the swiftest
smiles and outstretched hands, or with
a pretty song if one asks for it. Little
tots of three know any number of
the interminable chansons familiar in
France and Belgium. They chattered and
laughed, caught my hand as I went down
the stairs&mdash;for this dining-quarter is below
the sidewalk, in rooms that are known
as “caves.” I was prepared for something
dark and cheerless, instead I found
the whitewashed walls gay with nursery
pictures and Belgian and American flags.
The long tables were covered with bright
red-and-white checked oilcloth. The small
windows opening just above the sidewalk
allowed sufficient light and air to keep
everything fresh. The kitchen was immaculate&mdash;shelves
for shining vessels,
others for the sacks of sugar, boxes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>macaroni. On a table stood the inevitable
scales&mdash;Thursday is weighing day, when
one of the best physicians of Brussels examines
the children, recording the weights
that form the basis for judgment as to
the success of the ration.</p>

<p>The 430 bowls of milk were already on
the tables. Madame ... was hurrying
about among her helpers&mdash;twelve faithful
Belgian women. They had all been
there since eight o’clock, for this was a
<em>viande</em> day (there are three a week) and
when there is meat that must be cut into
little pieces for between four and five
hundred children, it means an early start.
Two women were still stirring (with long
wooden spoons) the great tub full of
savory macaroni and carrots&mdash;a test in
itself for muscle and endurance. The
meat was in separate kettles. The bread
had been cut into over 400 portions. The
phosphatine dessert (of which the children
can not get enough) was already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>served at a side table. The “Little Bees”
originated this phosphatine dessert, which
is a mixture of rice, wheat and maize&mdash;flour,
phosphate of lime and cocoa. They
have a factory for making it, and up to
August, 1916, had turned out 638,000
kilos.</p>

<p>A gentleman in black frock suit and
large hat came in to look about, and then
went back to the lengthening line. Madame
explained that he was the principal of the
communal school of the quarter, and that
he came every day to keep the children
in order. I learned, too, that on every
single day of the vacation, which had begun
and was to continue until the middle
of September, he and one of his teachers
went to the school to distribute to all the
school children the little roll of white
bread that they are allowed at eight-thirty
each morning. Many of these have
but little at home. This roll helps them
out until the cantine meal at eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>-thirty,
which can be had only on a physician’s
authorization. From now on a
larger meal is to be given in the schools&mdash;a
joy not only to the pupils but to their
teachers, who everywhere are devoting
themselves to this work of saving their
children. Several of the younger women
helping Madame had been working
wearily all the year in the professional
schools, but as soon as their vacations
arrived, begged to be allowed to give
their time to the cantines. They were
all most attractive in their white aprons
and caps&mdash;most serious in their attention
to the individual wants of that hungry
family.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the principal appeared
again&mdash;all was ready now. Then
the little ones began to march in. They
came by way of an anteroom, where they
had their hands washed, if they needed
washing&mdash;and most of them did&mdash;and
quite proudly held them up as they passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>by us. They were of all sizes between
three and fourteen. One pale little fellow
was led in by his grandmother who
was admitted (tho no mothers or grandmothers
are supposed to come inside), because
he wailed the minute she left him.
It was easy to see why mothers could not
be allowed, tho one was glad the rule
could be broken, and that this sad, white-faced
grandmother could feed her own
charge. It was terrible, too, to realize
what that plate of savory stew would
have meant to her, and to see that she
touched no morsel of it. Even if there
had been an extra portion, the women
could not have given it to her: the following
day the street would have been
filled with others, for whom there could
not possibly be extra portions.</p>

<p>If a child is too ill to come for its dinner,
a member of the family can carry it
home. Practically all the cantines have
a visiting nurse who investigates such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>cases, and keeps the number much lower
than it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>When I asked Madame how she was
able to give so much time (from about
8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> till 1 or 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> every day of the
year), she smiled and shrugged her
shoulders: “But that is the least one can
do, the very least! One never thinks of
the work, it is of the children&mdash;and we
know they love us&mdash;we see them being
kept alive! Some of them are getting
stronger&mdash;these weaklings. What more
can we wish?”</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"><abbr title="5">V</abbr></a></h2>

<p class="p110 center">MRS. WHITLOCK’S VISIT</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> second time, I visited Madame’s
cantine with the wife of the American
Minister, and I found what it
meant to be the wife of the United States
Minister in Belgium! From the corner
above to the entrance of the court the
street was lined with people. At the
gateway we were met by a committee
headed by the wife of the Bourgmestre of
Brussels. Within the court were the
hundreds of children&mdash;with many more
mothers this time&mdash;all waiting expectantly,
all specially scrubbed, tho no
amount of scrubbing could conceal their
sad lack of shoes. There were smiles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>and greetings and little hands stretched
out all along the line as we passed.</p>

<p>Inside there was no more than the
usual cleanliness&mdash;for the cantines are
scrupulously kept. Madame and her assistants
had tiny American flags pinned
to their white uniforms. In the corridors
the American and Belgian flags hung together.
A special permission had been
obtained to take a photograph of their
guest at the window.</p>

<p>The tables were laid, the lines began
moving. As the little girls filed in, one
of them came forward, and with a pretty
courtesy offered Mrs. Whitlock a large
bouquet of red roses. The boys followed,
and their representative, struggling with
shyness, recited a poem as he gave his
flowers. All the children were very much
imprest with this simple ceremony, and
under the two flags, as the quavering
little voice gave thanks to “those who
were bringing them their daily bread,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>there were no grown-ups without tears
in their eyes.</p>

<p>American flags of one kind or another
hang in all the cantines, along with pictures
of President Wilson, mottos expressing
thanks to America, C. R. B.
flour-sacks elaborately embroidered&mdash;on
all sides are attempts to express gratitude
and affection.</p>

<p>That morning, as the Legation car
turned a corner, a little old Flemish lady
in a white frilled cap stept forward and
clapped her hands as the American flag
floated by. Men lift their hats to it, children
salute it. In the shop windows one
often sees it draping the pictures of the
King and Queen!</p>

<p>This is not a tribute to the American
flag alone, but also to the personality of
the man who has so splendidly represented
this flag and to the men who carried the
American soul and its works into Belgium
through the C. R. B. Belgium will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>never forget its immediate debt to Brand
Whitlock and to these hundreds of Americans
whose personal service to this country
in its darkest hour is already a matter
of history. Just as Mrs. Whitlock was
leaving, Madame fortunately discovered
a shabby little girl who still squeezed a
bedraggled bunch of white roses&mdash;and
made her happy by bringing her forward
to present it.</p>

<p>These children, as I have said, are all
in need of special nourishment, they are
those who have fallen by the wayside in
the march, brought down by the stern
repression of the food supply. One of the
most striking effects of the war has been
the rapid increase in tuberculosis. Many
of the thousands in the cantines are the
victims of “glands” or some other dread
form of this disease.</p>

<p>However, in some respects the children
of the very poor are better off than they
have ever been. For the first time they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>are receiving nourishing food at regular
hours. And this ration, along with the
training in hygiene and medical attention,
is having its good effect.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-five physicians
are contributing their services to
the “Little Bees” in Brussels alone,
where, during the first six months of
1916, infant mortality had decreased 19
per cent. It would be difficult to estimate
the time given by physicians throughout
the whole country, but probably half of
the 4,700 are contributing practically all
their time, and almost all are doing something.
It is a common sight in the late
afternoon to see a physician who has had
a full, hard day, rushing to a cantine to
examine hundreds of children. Outside
the zone of military preparation, 200,000
sub-normal children of from three to
seventeen years, and over 53,000 babies
under three months, are on their “relief”
lists, besides a large number of adults.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>Outside Brussels, the cantines are conducted
in much the same way as those of
the “Little Bees.” Committees of women
everywhere are devoting themselves to
the children.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"><abbr title="6">VI</abbr></a></h2>

<p class="p110 center">THE BATHTUB</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Way</span> over in the northeast, in
Hasselt, a town of 17,000 inhabitants,
there is an especially
interesting cantine&mdash;only one of thousands
in Belgium, mind you! A year
ago, when a California professor was
leaving San Francisco to become a C. R.
B. representative, he was offered a farewell
dinner&mdash;and in the hall his hostess
placed a basket, with obvious intent! The
money was not for the general fund, but
to be spent by him personally for some
child in need.</p>

<p>He was assigned to Hasselt, for the
Province of Limbourg, and there he very
soon decided that a splendid young Belgian
woman who had been giving her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>whole time to nursing wounded soldiers
would be the person to know which of
their children was most in need of his
little fund. When he proposed turning it
over to her, she quite broke down at the
opportunity it offered. She and her
mother were living in a rather large
house, but on a limited income. She
would find the sick child and care for it
in her own home. A few days later the
professor called to see her “child”&mdash;and
he found twelve! She had not been able
to stop&mdash;most of them were children
whose fathers were at the front. They
were suffering from rickets, arrested development,
paralysis, malnutrition. She
was bathing them, feeding them, and following
the instructions of a physician,
whom she had already interested. Her
fund was two hundred and fifty dollars,
but in her hands it seemed inexhaustible.
She added children, one after another.
Then, finally, the Relief Committee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>came to the support of her splendid and
necessary work with its usual monthly
subsidy, with which the women buy the
supplies most needed from the relief
shops. She is now installed in the middle
of the town&mdash;with a kitchen and dining-room
downstairs, and a little clinic and
bathroom upstairs. The forty-six
centimes (less than ten cents) a day
which she received per child, enabled her
to furnish an excellent meal for each.
But she soon found that her children
could not be built up on one meal, and
she stretched her small subsidy to cover
a breakfast at eight and a dinner at
four to 100 children. She balances the
ration, makes the daily milk tests, looks
after every detail personally. Upstairs
in the prized tub devoted helpers
bathe the children who need washing,
care for their heads, and for all the
various ailments of a family of 100 sub-normal
children. Because of the glycerine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>it contains, soap has been put on the “non-entry”
list, which makes it so expensive
that the very poor are entirely without it.
The price has increased 300 per cent.
since the war. Incidentally, one of the
reasons for the high price of butter is
that it can be sold for making soap, at an
extraordinary figure.</p>

<p>This particular tub is a tribute to the
ingenuity of the present American representative&mdash;also
a professor, but from
farther East. Before the terrific problem
of giving children enough bread and
potatoes to keep them alive, bathrooms
sometimes appear an unnecessary luxury.
The relief committee could not furnish
Mademoiselle a bathroom! But to those
working with the sick and dirty children
it seemed all-essential. Hasselt is not a
rich town, everybody’s resources had
been drained&mdash;how should the money be
found? Finally the C. R. B. delegate
had an inspiration&mdash;there was a big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>swimming-tank in Hasselt. To the people,
the American representative, tho
loved, is always a more or less surprizing
person. If it could be announced that by
paying a small sum they could see the
strange American swim, everybody who
had the small sum would come&mdash;he would
swim for the bathroom! It was announced,
and they came, and that swimming
f&ecirc;te will go down in the annals of
the town! The cantine got its bathroom,
and there was enough left over to
buy a very necessary baby-scales.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle took us to the houses
where we saw the misery of mothers left
with seven, nine, eleven children, in one
or two little rooms. There was no wage-earner&mdash;he
was at the front; or there
was no work. One woman was crying as
we went in. She explained that her son,
“a bad one,” had just been trying to take
his father’s boots. She pulled out from
behind the basket where the twins were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>sleeping under the day’s washing, a battered
pair of coarse, high boots. There
were holes in the hob-nailed soles, there
was practically no heel left. The heavy
tops still testified to an original stout
leather, but never could one see a more
miserable, run-down-at-the-heel, leaky,
and useless pair of boots. Yet to that
woman they represented a fortune&mdash;there
is practically no leather left in the
country, and if there were, how could her
man, when he came back, have the money
to buy another pair, and how could he
work in the fields without his boots?
There were eight children&mdash;eight had
died.</p>

<p>And she wept bitterly because of the
son who had tried to take his father’s
boots, as she hid them behind the twin’s
basket. I had heard of the sword as the
symbol of the honor and power of the
house; in bitter reality it is the father’s
one pair of boots!</p>

<p class="p110 center">THE BREAD IN THE HAND</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">I soon</span> came to have the curious
feeling about the silent stone fronts
of the houses that if I could but
look through them I should see women
sorting garments, women making patterns
for lace, women ladling soup, painting
toys, washing babies. Up and down
the stairs of these inconvenient buildings
they are running all day long, back and
forth, day after day, seeking through a
heroic cheerfulness, a courageous smile,
to hold back tears.</p>

<p>And chiefly I was overwhelmed by the
enormous quantities of food they are
handling. The whole city seems turned
into a kitchen&mdash;and there follows the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>evitable
question: “Where does it all
come from?” The women who are doing
the work connect directly with the local
Belgian organizations, by the great system
of decentralization, which is the keynote
of the C. R. B. Just these three
magic letters spell the answer to the inevitable
question.</p>

<p>At the C. R. B. bureau I had seen
the charts lining the corridors. They
seemed alive, changing every day, marking
the ships on the ocean, the number of
tons of rice, wheat, maize or sugar expected;
and how these tons count up! In
the two years that have passed, 1,000,000
tons each year, meaning practically one
ship every weekday in the month; 90,000
tons at one time on the Atlantic! Other
charts show the transit of goods already
unloaded at Rotterdam. Over 200
lighters are in constant movement on
their way down the canals to the various
C. R. B. warehouses, which means about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>50,000 tons afloat all the time. I had
seen, too, the reports of the enormous
quantities of clothing brought in&mdash;4,000,000
dollars worth, almost all of it
the free gift of the United States.</p>

<p>In the director’s room were other maps
showing the territory in charge of each
American. Back of every cantine and its
power to work stands this American, the
living guaranty to England that the
Germans are not getting the food, the
guaranty to Germany of an equal neutrality,
and to the Belgians themselves the
guaranty that the gifts of the world to
her, and those of herself to her own people,
would be brought in as wheat through
the steel ring that had cut her off. One
had only to think of the C. R. B. door in
the steel ring as closed, to realize the position
of this neutral commission. The
total result of their daily and hourly co-ordination
of all this organization inside
Belgium, their solitude for each class of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>the population, their dull and dry calculations
of protein, fat and carbohydrates,
bills of lading, cars, canal boats, mills and
what not, is the replenishing of the life-stream
of a nation’s blood.</p>

<p>Thus, the food dispensed by the women
is part of the constantly entering mass,
and between its purchase, or its receipt as
gift by the C. R. B., and its appearance
as soup for adults, or pudding for children,
is the whole intricate structure of
the relief organization. The audible
music of this creation is the clatter of
hundreds of typewriters, the tooting of
tugs and shrieks of locomotives, but the
undertones are the harmonies of devotion.</p>

<p>Everybody who can pay for his food
must do so&mdash;it is sold at a fair profit, and
it is this profit, gained from those who
still have money, that goes over to the
women in charge of the cantines for the
purchase of supplies for the destitute.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>They often supplement this subsidy
through a house-to-house appeal to the
people. For instance, in Brussels, the
“Little Bees” are untiring in their canvass.
Basket on arm, continually they
solicit an egg, a bunch of carrots, a bit
of meat, or a money gift. They have
been able to count on about 5,000 eggs
and about 2,500 francs a week, besides
various other things. Naturally, the people
in the poorer sections can contribute
but small amounts, but it is here that one
finds the most touching examples of
generosity&mdash;the old story of those who
have suffered and understood. One
woman who earns just a franc a day and
on it has to support herself and her
family, carefully wraps her weekly two-centime
piece (two-fifths of a cent) and
has it ready when one of the “Little
Bees” calls for it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Our American Young Men</span></p>

<p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> ..., a committee leader in the
Hainaut, once said to me, “Madame, one
of the big things Belgium will win in this
war is a true appreciation of the character
and capacity (quite aside from their
idealism) of American young men.</p>

<p>“I’ll confess,” he continued, “that when
that initial group of young Americans
came rushing in with those first heaven-sent
cargoes of wheat, we were not
strongly reassured. We knew that for
the moment we were saved, but it was
difficult to see how these youths, however
zealous and clear-eyed, were going to
meet the disaster as we knew it.</p>

<p>“We organized, as you know, our local
committees, and headed them by our Belgians
of widest experience; our lawyers
of fifty or sixty, our bankers, our leaders
of industry. We could set all the machinery,
but nothing would work unless the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>Americans would stand with us. The instructions
read: ‘The American and your
Belgian chairmen will jointly manage the
relief.’</p>

<p>“And who came to stand with us?
Who came to stand with me, for instance?
You see,” and he pointed to splendid
broad-shouldered C. ahead of us, “that
lad&mdash;not a day over twenty-eight&mdash;just
about the age of my boys in the trenches,
and who, heaven knows, is now almost as
dear to us as they!</p>

<p>“But in the beginning I couldn’t see it;
I simply couldn’t believe C. was going to
be able to handle his end of our terrific
problem. But day by day I watched this
lad quietly getting a sense of the situation,
then plunging into it, getting under
it, developing an instinct for diplomacy
along with his natural genius for directness
and practicality that bewildered me.
It has amazed us all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“We soon learned that we need not
fear to trust ourselves to that type of
character, to its adaptability and capacity,
no matter how young it seemed.”</p>

<p>Of course there have been older Americans
who have brought to their Belgian
co-workers equal years as well as experience,
but one of the pictures I like best to
remember is this of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span> ..., a
Belgian of fifty-five or sixty, in counsel
with his eager American d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute; of
twenty-eight. To the partnership, friendship,
confidence, the Belgian added something
paternal, and the American responded
with a devotion one feels is lifelong.</p>

<p>Between the visits to mills and docks,
and the grinding over accounts, orders
of canal boats and warehouses, there are
hours for other things. I remember one
restful one spent at this same Monsieur’s
table&mdash;he is an excellent Latin scholar
and a wise philosopher&mdash;when he and
his young American friend for a time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>forgot the wheat and fat in their delight
to get back to Virgil and Horace.</p>

<p>Young D., a Yale graduate, furnished
another example of these qualities Monsieur
stressed. If he had been a Westerner,
his particular achievement would
have been less surprizing, but he came
from the East.</p>

<p>He reached Belgium at the time of a
milk crisis. We were attempting, and, in
fact, had practically arranged, the plan
to establish C. R. B. herds adjacent to
towns, to insure a positive supply for tiny
babies. The local committees went at it,
but one after another came in with discouraging
reports. Even their own people
were often preventing success by fearing
and sometimes by flatly refusing to
turn their precious cows into a community
herd. Then one day D., who, so far as I
know, had never in his career been within
speaking distance of a cow, put on something
that looked like a sombrero and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>swung out across his province. We had
hardly had time to speculate about what
he might accomplish, before he returned
to announce that he had rounded up a
magnificent herd, and that <em>his</em> district was
ready to guarantee so much pure milk
from that time on!</p>

<p>“What had he done, where we had
failed?” asked Monsieur. “He had called
a meeting of farmers in each commune,
and said: ‘We, the Americans, want from
this commune five or ten cows for the
babies of your cities. We give ourselves
to Belgium, you give your cows to us.
We will give them back when the war is
over&mdash;if they are alive!’ And he got
them!” They would have given this
cheerful beggar anything&mdash;these stolid
old Flemish peasants.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"><abbr title="8">VIII</abbr></a></h2>

<p class="p110 center">ONE WOMAN</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The world</span> will be incredulous when
it is given the final picture of the
complexity and completeness of
the Belgian Relief Organization. In all
the communes, all the provinces, in the
capital, for over two years, groups of Belgians
have been shut in their bureaux
with figures and plans, matching needs
with relief.</p>

<p>There must be bread and clothing for
everybody, shelter for the homeless, soup
for the hungry, food boxes for prisoners
in Germany, milk for babies, special
nourishment for the tubercular, orphanages
and cr&egrave;ches for the tiny war victims,
work for the idle, some means of secours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>for merchants, artists, teachers and
thousands of “ashamed poor”&mdash;665,000
idle workmen with their 1,000,000 dependents,
1,250,000 on the soupes, 53,000
babies and 200,000 children under normal
health in the cantines&mdash;how much of the
story can these figures tell?</p>

<p>Yet the efforts of the organization have
been so continuous and comprehensive,
the C. R. B. has been so steadily bringing
to them the vital foodstuffs, and holding
for them the guaranty of their freedom
to act, that from the committee-rooms it
has sometimes seemed as if there were
really nothing more to be done for Belgium!</p>

<p>But one has only to spend a few days
at the other end, to get quickly disabused
of this idea! No amount of organization
can truly meet the needs of the seven and
a half million people of a small industrial
country, suddenly and entirely cut off
from all normal contact with the rest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>the world. Despite all the food that has
been distributed, the resistance of the people
has been lowered. Tuberculosis has
seized its opportunity, and is making
rapid strides. I have visited home after
home where a heartbreaking courage was
trying to cover up a losing struggle. Over
and above all the organized “Relief,”
there remains an enormous task for just
such splendid women as Madame....</p>

<p>Madame is the wife of a lawyer, with
two sons at the front. As soon as the
war broke out she organized a Red Cross
center. Then the refugees came pouring
into Brussels, and she felt that among
them there must be many to whom it
would be torture to be crowded into the
big relief shelters. She said little, but
by the end of August she had managed to
squeeze five families in with her own.
From the day the Germans abolished the
Belgian Red Cross she gave her entire
time to helping the homeless who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>been in comfortable circumstances before
the war to some quiet corner where they
might wait its end. There was never any
announcement of her work, but the word
spread like wildfire&mdash;many had to be
turned away daily. Then she found a
big home on the Boulevard, rather shabby
inside, but conveniently arranged for
suites of two or even three rooms. Here
a considerable number of families might
have space for a complete m&eacute;nage; plenty
of light and air, and room to cook and
sleep. Before long she was housing
ninety-eight, but a few of these were able
to re-establish themselves, so when I
visited her in September, 1916, there were
sixty-five. As her own funds were
limited, and fast disappearing, she had
in the end to appeal to the “Relief” to
subsidize this “Home.”</p>

<p>On the first floor she had a little pantry-shop,
where each family received the permitted
ration of bread, sugar, bacon and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>other foodstuffs. One day a woman came
to her, hungry. She was a widow with
two little girls, who, before the war, had
earned a good salary in the post-office.
Somehow she had managed to exist for
two years, but now there was nothing left.
She was given charge of the pantry at
ten cents a day. I have seen many processions
of people descending long stairways.
I shall forget them. But I shall
never forget this one of the refugees
from the upper floors winding down the
stairways at the shop hour, with their
pathetic plates and bowls ready for the
bacon and bread that made living possible.
They could, perhaps, add vegetables and
fruit, or an egg or two, to the ration to
piece out the meal. On the lowest shelf
of this miniature shop were a few dozen
cans of American corn, which even yet
the people have not learned to like. Having
been brought up to regard corn in
all forms as fit only for cattle and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>chickens, even disaster can not convince
them that it is a proper food for man!</p>

<p>Later we went upstairs to visit some
of the apartments. They were bright and
clean, with cheery flower-pots on all the
window-sills. Every one showed a fine
appreciation of what was done for him
by making the most of all he had; an attitude
quite different from that of many
less used to comfort, less intelligent, who
neither hesitate to demand charity, nor to
complain of what they receive. Each
family had a small, practical stove, which
served for both cooking and heating.</p>

<p>One family of eight was content in its
two rooms. They had had a copper shop
and a pension at Dinant; were very comfortably
off, when, suddenly, Dinant was
struck. All their property was in flames,
men were being shot, their own grandmother,
eighty-one years old, had her leg
broken, and, terror-stricken, they fled with
her up and down hill, over rocks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>through brush till they reached Namur,
and finally arrived at Brussels where they
heard of Madame’s “Home.” The grandmother,
whose leg is mended but still
crooked, was sitting in front of the red
geraniums at a window, knitting socks.
She knits one pair a week and receives five
cents for each pair from the clothing committee.
The young girls help Madame in
various ways; the father tries to work in
copper, but if he earns fifty cents a week,
considers himself lucky. The particular
struggle for this family is to get eggs
for the grandmother, who can not get
along on the bacon and bread. Eggs cost
ten cents each. Happily, this is a kind of
situation that “special funds” from the
United States have often relieved. Everybody
was courageous, trying simply to
hold on till the terrible war should be
ended and he could go back to rebuild
something on the ruins of his home.</p>

<p>There was another Dinant m&eacute;nage next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>door, but a m&eacute;nage for one. I quickly
read this poor woman’s story on the walls.
On one was tacked a large picture of
Dinant, beautiful, smiling, winding along
the river, as in July, 1914. Above it was
the photograph of her husband, shot in
August; on the other wall a handsome
son in uniform. He was at the front.
She stopt peeling her potatoes to go over
again those horrible days. They had
been so well-off, so happy, father, mother
and son. When they saw their city in
flames, they were too bewildered, too
terror-stricken to realize what it meant.
Her husband left to help restore a bridge&mdash;he
did not return. The son hurried to
follow his King; she somehow reached
Brussels.</p>

<p>There was a fine young chap of about
fifteen, whose father had been killed at
Manceau sur Sambre. He and his mother
had found this haven, but now she was in
the hospital undergoing a capital opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>tion.
Madame was trying to arrange a
special diet for her on her return. They
had been in very comfortable circumstances;
now everything was gone.</p>

<p>And so it was&mdash;the same story, and
from all parts of Belgium. They had
come from Verviers, Aerschot, Dinant,
from Termonde and Ypres&mdash;the striking
thing was the courage, the gentleness, the
fine spirit of all.</p>

<p>This “Home,” as I said, has now been
subsidized, but along with it Madame still
carries on another admirable work entirely
on her own responsibility. Some
friends help her, but she really lives from
day to day! On the ground floor of this
same building she has a restaurant, also
known only as the word passes from
mouth to mouth, where any one may
come for a good dinner at noon. There
is no limit to what one may pay, but the
charge is a franc, or twenty cents. The
majority pay less.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>It has quite the atmosphere of one of
the little Paris restaurants of the Latin
quarter&mdash;two adjoining rooms bright with
flowers and colored cloths and gay china,
separated from the kitchen only by
screens. It is frequented chiefly by
artists and teachers, some young girls
from the shops, and a few business men.
Madame does not go from table to table
as the Paris host does, greeting his guests,
but they come to her table to shake hands
and chat for a minute. They linger over
their coffee&mdash;there is the general atmosphere
of cheer and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien &ecirc;tre</i>. And what
this means in this time of gloom to the
sixty or more who gather there daily!</p>

<p>Young girls of the families of the refugees
serve the meals. The cook, herself
a refugee, works for twenty francs a
month.</p>

<p>I said any one might come, but that is,
of course, not exact. Any one may ask
to come, but he must prove to Madame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>that he needs to come. After he explains
his situation, she has ways of checking up
this information and deciding herself
whether the need is a real one. The dinner
consists of soup, a meat and vegetable
dish, and dessert, with beer or coffee.</p>

<p>I was looking over the meal tickets and
noticed that while most of them were
unstamped (the one franc ones) a good
number had distinguishing marks. Then
I learned that if a person was unable to
pay a franc for this meal, he might have
it for fifteen or even ten cents, and his
ticket was stamped accordingly. I found
one ticket with no stamp, but with the
“o” of “No” blotted out. This might
be chance, but after finding a half-dozen
or more with this same ink blot, I suspected
a meaning. And the explanation
revealed the spirit of Madame’s work.
“Yes,” she said, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>“there is a meaning.
There are some so badly off that they can
pay nothing; to save them the pain of
having to look at, and to have others look
at, a stamp registering this misery, I do
not stamp their tickets, but, since I must
keep count, I blot that little ‘o,’ which
at once suggests ‘zero’ to me!”</p>

<p>Choosing at random, I found registered
for one day in July, 1916:</p>


<p> 1 dinner at 1 franc, 10 centimes.</p>
<p>58 dinners at 1 franc.</p>
<p>43 dinners at 75 centimes (15 cents).</p>
<p>10 dinners at 50 centimes.</p>
<p> 4 dinners at 0.</p>

<p class="p110 center">THE CITY OF THE CARDINAL</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Unquestionably</span> the Belgian
above all others the Germans would
rid themselves of if they could, is
Cardinal Mercier. He is the exalted
Prince of the Church, but in the hour of
decision, he stept swiftly down and, with
a ringing call to courage, took his place
with the people. Ever since that day he
has helped them to stand united, defiant,
waiting the day of liberation. Others
have been silenced by imprisonment or
death, but the greatest power has not
dared to lay hands on the Cardinal. He
is the voice, not only of the Church, but
of Belgium heartening her children.</p>

<p>Malines has her cantines and soupes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>and ouvroirs, all the branches of secours
necessary to a city that was one of the
centers of attack; but these are not the
most interesting things about Malines.
It is above all as the city of the Cardinal
that she stands forth in this war. Her
“&oelig;uvre” has been to give moral and
spiritual secours, not only to her own
people, but to those of every part of Belgium.</p>

<p>Since under the “occupation” the press
has naturally been “controlled,” this
secours has been distributed chiefly
through the famous letters of the Cardinal
sent to priests to be re-read to their
people. We remember the thrill with
which the first one was read in America.
After the war there will be pilgrimages
to the little room where it was printed.
I had the privilege of having it shown me
by that friend of the Cardinal who was
the printer of the first letter, and whose
brother was at this time a prisoner in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>Germany for having printed the second.
The room was much as it had been left
after the search; books were still disarranged
on their shelves, papers and
pamphlets heaped in confusion on the
tables. The red seals with which the
Germans had closed the keyholes had
been broken, but their edges still remained.
Standing in the midst of the
disarray, remembering that the owner
had already been six months in a German
prison, and looking out on the shattered
fa&ccedil;ade at the end of the garden, I realized,
at least partly, another moment of the
war.</p>

<p>This quickening secours, then, is distributed
chiefly by letter, but continually
by presence and speech in Malines itself,
and occasionally in other parts of the
country. On the 21st of July, 1916, the
anniversary of the independence of Belgium,
all Brussels knew that the Cardinal
was coming to celebrate high mass in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Sainte Gudule. The mass was to begin
at 11 o’clock, but at 9.30 practically every
foot of standing-room in the vast cathedral
was taken. In the dimness a great
sea of people waited patiently, silently,
the arrival of their leader. Occasionally
a whispered question or rumor flashed
along the nave. “He has come!” “He
has been prevented!” There was a tacit
understanding that there should be no
demonstration&mdash;the Cardinal himself had
ordered it. Every one was trying to control
himself, and yet, as the air grew
thicker, and others fought their way into
the already packed transepts, one felt that
anything might happen! Almost every
person had a bit of green ribbon (color
of hope) or an ivy leaf (symbol of endurance)
pinned to his coat. The wearing
of the national colors was strictly forbidden,
but the national spirit found
another way: green swiftly replaced the
orange, black and red.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>We all knew that this meant trouble
for Brussels, and the fact that the shops
(which had all been ordered to keep open
this holiday) were carrying on a continuous
comedy at the expense of the
Germans, did not help matters. Their
doors were open, to be sure, but in many,
the passage was blocked by the five or
six employees who sat in stiff rows with
bows of green ribbon in their buttonholes,
and indescribable expressions on their
faces. In the biggest chocolate shop, the
window display was an old pail of dirty
water with a slimsy rag thrown near it.
There was no person inside but the owner,
who stood beside the cash register in
dramatic and defiant attitude, smoking a
pipe. There were crowds in front of the
window which displayed large photographs
of the King and Queen, draped
with the American flag. Another shop
had only an enormous green bow in the
window. Almost every one took some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>part in the play. Not a Belgian entered
a shop, and if a German was brave enough
to, he was usually made the victim of his
courage. One was delighted to serve
him, but, unfortunately, peaches had advanced
to ten francs each, or something
of the sort!</p>

<p>Finally, after an hour and a half, a
priest made an announcement, which
from our distance we misunderstood. We
thought he said that the mass would be
celebrated, but unfortunately not by
Monseigneur, who had been detained. A
few of us worked our way, inch by inch,
to the transept door, and out into the
street. There I found an excited group
running around the rear of the cathedral
to the sacristy-door, and, when I reached
it, I learned the Cardinal had just passed
through.</p>

<p>For no particular reason I waited there,
and before long the door was partly
opened by an acolyte, who was apparently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>expecting some one. He saw me and
agreed that I might enter if I wished, for
was I not an American to whom all
Belgium is open? So I slipt in and
found room to stand just behind the altar
screen where all through the celebration
I could watch the face of the Cardinal&mdash;a
face at once keen and tender, strong,
fearless, devout: one could read it all
there. He was tall, thin, dominating, a
heroic figure, in his gorgeous scarlet vestments,
officiating at the altar of this
beautiful Gothic cathedral.</p>

<p>The congregation remained silent, three
or four fainting women were carried out,
that was all. Then the Cardinal mounted
the pulpit at the further end of the nave to
deliver his message, the same message he
had been preaching for two years&mdash;they
must hold themselves courageous, unconquered,
with stedfast faith in God and in
their final liberation. Tears were in the
eyes of many, but there was no crying out.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>From the pulpit he came back to the
catafalque erected in the middle of the
nave for the Belgian soldiers dead in
battle. It represented a great raised
coffin, simply and beautifully draped with
Belgian flags, veiled in cr&ecirc;pe. Tall, flaming
candles surrounded it. As the Cardinal
approached, the dignitaries of the
city, who had been occupying seats of
honor below the altar, marched solemnly
down and formed a circle about the
catafalque. Then the Cardinal read the
service for the dead. The dim light of
the cathedral, the sea of silent people, the
memorial coffin under the flag and lighted
by tall candles, the circle of those chosen
to represent the city, the sad-faced Cardinal
saying the prayers for those who had
died in defense of the flag that now
covered them&mdash;was it strange that as his
voice ceased and he moved slowly toward
the sacristy-door by which he was to depart,
the overwhelming tide of emo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>tion
swept barriers, and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le Roi!</span>”
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive Monseigneur!</span>” echoed once more
from these ancient walls! We held our
breath. Men were pressing by me
whispering, “What shall we do? We
have necessity to cry out&mdash;after two
years, we <em>must</em> cry out!” The Cardinal
went straight forward, looking neither to
the right nor the left, the tears streaming
down his cheeks.</p>

<p>Outside, to pass from the rear of the
cathedral to the Archbishop’s palace, he
was obliged to cross the road. As I
turned up this road to go back to the
main portal, the crowd came surging
down, arms outthrust, running, waving
handkerchiefs and canes, pushing aside
the few helpless Belgian police, quite beyond
control, and shouting wildly now,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le Roi!</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive Monseigneur!</span>”
I was able to struggle free only after the
gate had closed on the Cardinal.</p>

<p>This was the day when in times of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>peace all the populace brought wreaths
to the foot of the statue erected in honor
of the soldiers who died for the independence
of Belgium. The Germans had
placed guards in the square and forbidden
any one to go near it. So all day
long throngs of people, a constant, steady
procession marched along the street
beyond, each man lifting his hat, women
often their green parasols, as soon as
they came in view of their statue. All
these things, I repeat, did not help Brussels
in the matter of the demonstration at
the cathedral. And a few days later a
posted notice informed her that she had
been fined 1,000,000 marks!</p>

<p>But the people had seen their Cardinal&mdash;they
had received their spiritual
secours&mdash;he had brought heavenly comfort
to their hearts, put new iron in their
blood. They had dared to cry just once
their loyalty to him and to their King,
and they laughed at the 1,000,000 marks!</p>

<p class="p110 center">THE TEACHERS</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">One</span> afternoon I happened by a
communal school in another
crowded quarter of Brussels, and,
tho it was vacation, and I knew the principal
had been sadly overworked for two
years and ought to be in the country, I
decided to knock at the bureau to see if
he were in.</p>

<p>I had my answer in the corridor, where
rows of unhappy mothers and miserable
fathers were waiting to see him. Inside
there were more. He was examining a
little girl with a very bad eye; and I
realized why there could be no vacation
for the principal!</p>

<p>As I sat there, I heard the noise of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>marching in the court below, and when I
asked what it was, he opened the window
for me to see. There were 720 children
between six and fourteen years, gaily
tramping round and round under the
trees, making their “promenade” before
the 4 o’clock “repas scolaire” (school
children’s repast) which the Relief Organization
is now trying to furnish to
each of the 1,200,000 children in the free
schools of Belgium who may need it&mdash;incidentally
at an outlay of $2,500,000 a
month.</p>

<p>Over 8,500 children in the sixty communal
schools of Brussels proper receive
this dinner. It is quite distinct from the
eleven o’clock meal furnished at the cantines
for children below normal health&mdash;they
may have both&mdash;and it is served in
the school building. Naturally the school-teachers
are carrying a large share in
this stupendous undertaking.</p>

<p>For the children, the “repas” is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>great event of the day, and, since the
vacation, they gather long before the
hour. One sees, too, hundreds of little
ones on the sidewalks before the Enfants
D&eacute;biles dining-rooms, as early as 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
clutching their precious cards and waiting
already for their eleven o’clock potatoes
and phosphatine.</p>

<p>This school is also a communal soup
center, tho the teachers have nothing to
do with the distribution. Every day
from 2,500 to 3,000 men and women line
up&mdash;worn, white enamel pitchers in one
hand, cards in the other, to receive the
family ration of soup and bread.</p>

<p>As I passed one morning, I saw a little
bare-legged girl sitting on a doorstep opposite.
Her mother had evidently left
her to guard their portion, and she sat
huddled up against the tall, battered
pitcher full of steaming soup, her little
arms tight about four round loaves&mdash;which
meant many brothers and sisters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>The father was in the trenches. She sat
there, a slim, wistful little thing, guarding
the soup and bread, the picture of
what war means to women and children.</p>

<p>Monsieur was particularly happy because
he had just succeeded in sending
fifteen children, who very much needed to
be built up, to the seacoast for fifteen
days. It is his hope to establish homes,
in the country so far as possible, which
shall be limited to from thirty to forty
children.</p>

<p>He has continually to arrange, too, for
the care of those who may not be in truth
orphans, but who belong to the thousands
of wretched little ones set adrift by the
war. I saw one little boy who had been
found all alone in a most pitiful plight
beside a gun, in one of the devastated districts.
If his parents are still living, no
one has yet succeeded in tracing them.</p>

<p>That morning an old uncle had begged
Monsieur to take charge of his nephew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>and niece; he had not a penny left, they
must starve unless something were done
for them. Some months before, the father
had been wounded at the front, and the
mother had foolishly hurried away to try
to reach him, leaving the children with
her brother. Months had gone by&mdash;he
had had no word from any one&mdash;and
now he was quite at the end of his resources.
And so it was with case after
case. Something <em>must</em> be done!</p>

<p>Besides being the section kitchen and
dining-room, this school has become a
social center. Every Sunday afternoon
the children are invited to gather there
to have a good time. They are taught to
play games, each is given a bonbon, a
simple sweet of some sort&mdash;“nothing of
the kind to encourage luxury!” They
are occupied, happy, and kept off the
streets and out of homes made miserable
through lack of employment.</p>

<p>We see, then, that “every day” means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>literally <em>every</em> day, and we realize how
arduous is the task of the thousands of
devoted teachers who are standing between
the war and those who would otherwise
be its victims.</p>

<p>And as they tell us over and over again
that the one thing that makes them able
to stand is their confidence in the love
and sympathy of the United States, we
begin to realize our responsibility. It
is not only that the wheat and cloth
are essential, the encouragement of
the presence of even the few (forty
to fifty) Americans is the <em>great</em> necessity!</p>

<p>At 8.30 the next morning I visited one
of the “Jardins d’Enfants”&mdash;schools for
children between two and a half and six
years of age. There were the teachers
already busy in that new department of
their work&mdash;the war-food department;
460 tiny tots were being given their first
meal of the day&mdash;a cup of hot cocoa, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>during that month, a little white bread
bun. No American can understand what
this single piece of <em>white</em> bread means to
a French or Belgian child. I am sure
that if a tempting course dinner were set
at one side, and a slice of white bread at
the other, he would not hesitate to choose
the bread. It is white bread that they all
beg for, tho the brown war bread made
from flour milled at 82 per cent. is really
very palatable, and superior to the war
bread of other countries.</p>

<p>A sheaf of letters sent from a school in
Lille to thank the C. R. B. director for
the improved brown (not nearly white)
bread gave me my first impression of the
all-importance of the color and quality of
the bread.</p>

<p>Am&eacute;lie B. wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Before May 5, 1915, we had to eat
black bread, which we preferred to make
into flowers of all sorts as souvenirs of
the war! But after that date we have
had the good, light bread&mdash;so eatable.
It is for this we thank you.”</p>

<p>Another says:</p>

<p>“Since we have had the <em>good</em> bread the
happiest people are the mothers, who before
had to let their “chers petits” suffer
from hunger, because their delicate
stomachs would not digest the bad, black
bread.”</p>

<p>Further:</p>

<p>“The mothers of little children wept
with joy and blest you, as they went to
get their good, light bread.”</p>

<p>One little girl wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“When on the 5th of May, 1915,
maman returned with the new bread,
and we all ran to taste it, we found it
good. The bread we had been eating
long months had been dark and moist.
Further, rice had been our daily food. It
is without doubt to show your gratitude
to the French, who went to drive the
English away from you in 1783, that you
have thought to soften our suffering.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci</span>! <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci</span>! Many died because of
that bad bread, and many more should
have died, had you not come to our aid
with the good bread.”</p>

<p>Another little girl writes:</p>

<p>“If ever in the future America is in
need, France will not forget the good she
has done and will reach a hospitable hand
to her second country, who has saved her
unhappy children. It is you who have
made it possible for all mothers to give
bread to their children. Without the rice
and beans, what would have become of
us! You have helped us to have coal and
warm clothing against the cold. In the
name of all the mothers we thank you,
and all the little children send you a great
kiss of thanks.”</p>

<p>The babies had all finished their cocoa
and buns, so I went to the Girls’ Technical
Training School in the neighborhood.
It was having a particularly hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>time because of the lack of materials and
of opportunity to sell the articles made
by the children. But two wonderful
women&mdash;one the director, the other the
art teacher&mdash;were courageously fighting
to keep things going.</p>

<p>The pupils are largely from poor families.
When they were going through the
beautiful figures of their gymnasium exercise
for me, I saw that the bloomers
were mostly made of odds and ends of
cloth. The shoes, too, quickly told the
tale&mdash;all sorts of substitutes for leather,
patched woolen shoes or slippers, wooden
soles with cloth tops, clogs.</p>

<p>In the room for design I was greeted
with most cordial smiles as Madame introduced
me as her friend from America,
the country which meant hope to them.
Then happened swiftly one of the things
it is difficult to prevent&mdash;the shouting in
one breath of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le Roi!</span>” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive
l’Am&eacute;rique</span>!” Who would doubt that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>good part of the joy of shouting “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive
l’Am&eacute;rique</span>” comes from the opportunity
it gives them to couple with it the cry of
their hearts, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la Belgique</span>!”</p>

<p>By the time we returned to her bureau,
Madame trusted me entirely, and explained
that this was the center of a kind
of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Assistance Discr&egrave;te</span>” she had established
for her girls and their families. She
opened several cabinets, and showed me
what they had made to help one another.
Certain women have been contributing
materials&mdash;old garments, bits of cloth,
trimming for hats, all of which have been
employed to extraordinary advantage.
What struck me most were the attractive
little babies’ shirts, made from the upper
parts of worn stockings.</p>

<p>Madame opened a paper sack and
showed me nine hard-boiled eggs that
were to be given to the weaker girls, who
most needed extra nourishment that day.</p>

<p>Her most precious possession was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>record of the gifts of the pupils and their
friends for this “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Assistance Discr&egrave;te</span>.” It
is a list of contributions of a few centimes,
or a franc or two, given as thank offerings
for some blessing; oftenest for recovery
from illness, or for good news received.
It showed, too, that the children
had been bringing all the potato peelings
from home, to be sold as food for cattle.
Sometimes a girl brought as much as
twenty-eight centimes (over five cents)
worth of peelings. But in May, 1916,
the potato peelings stopt&mdash;they were not
having potatoes at home.</p>

<p class="p110 center">GABRIELLE’S BABY</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Before</span> the war Madame was very
close to the Queen. She lived in
our quarter of Brussels; we became
friends. And how generous the friendship
between a Belgian and an American
can be, only the members of the Commission
for Relief truly know! It is swift
and complete.</p>

<p>I had been in Brussels five months
when she said to me one day:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear, I understand only too well
the difficulties of your position&mdash;the
guaranty you gave on entering. As
you know, I have never once suggested
that you carry a note for me, or bring a
message&mdash;tho I have seen you starting in
your car behind your blessed little white
flag for the city of my daughter and my
grandchildren! Nor have I,” she laughed,
with the swift play so typical of the Belgian
mind, “once hinted at a pound of
butter or a potato! But lately I have
been suffering so many, many fears, that
I am tempted just to ask if you think this
would be wrong for you&mdash;if it would,
forget that I asked it: I have a relation
who has always been closer to me than a
brother&mdash;we were brought up together.
He is eighty-two now, and, at the beginning
of the war, was living near X in
Occupied France. He was important in
his district, his name is known. Now, if
I should merely give you that name, and,
when you next see your American delegate
from that district, you should speak
it, might it not be possible that he would
recognize it, and could tell you if my dear,
dear M. is suffering, or if he is yet able
to care for himself? Would that be breaking
your agreement?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>As she stood there&mdash;intelligence, distinction
speaking from all her person&mdash;fearfully
putting this pitiful question, I
experienced another of those maddening
moments we live through in Belgium.
One swiftly doubts one’s reason&mdash;the
situation&mdash;everything! The world simply
can not be so completely lost as it seems!</p>

<p>Mercifully this would not be breaking
any promise; and I begged for the name.</p>

<p>But even then I was rather hopeless
that our American would know. In the
North of France he must live with his
German officer; he is not free to mingle
with the French people.</p>

<p>Thursday, conference day, came,
when all the little white flags rush in
from their provinces, bringing our
splendid American men&mdash;their faces
stern, strained, but with that beautiful
light in them that testifies they are giving
without measure the best they have
to others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>Never will any one, who has experienced
it, forget the thrill he felt when
he saw those fifteen cars with their
forty-two men rushing up, one after the
other to 66, rue des Colonies, nor the
line of them all day on the curb with
their fluttering white flags carrying the
red C. R. B.! There were no other cars
to be seen. Each person, as he passed,
knew that these fifteen white flags
meant wheat and life to 10,000,000
people.</p>

<p>As I stood there I heard a band. I
looked up the street and saw the German
soldiers goose-stepping before their
guard mount. This happens every
morning, just a square above our offices.
The white flags and the goose-step&mdash;they
pretty much sum up the situation!</p>

<p>I hurried inside, hoping fervently to
hear the longed-for answer, as I put the
name and my question.</p>

<p>But the name was strange to S., he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>could tell me nothing, tho he felt sure
that by keeping his ears open that week,
he might learn something.</p>

<p>How often through those days I
thought of these two, caught in this war-night
of separation. For two and a
half years neither had been able to call
across it even the name of the other.
And then of the word thrown into the
night with hope and prayer!</p>

<p>On the next meeting day, as he hurried
toward me, I could see from S.’s
face that he had news. “Yes,” he said
eagerly, “he is still there, he draws his
ration&mdash;he is not suffering from want,
he has enough left to pay for his food.
But when he heard that somebody
would possibly carry this news to his
dearest living relation, he cried: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>‘Oh!
Would it not be possible to do just
one thing more! I am eighty-two;
I may die before this terrible war is
ended. In pity will not somebody tell me
before I die if any of my nieces has had
a little baby, or if any one of them is
going to have a little baby?’”</p>

<p>“And now,” S. said, “you and I
know that if the Relief stops, we’ve got to
find out for that poor old man that there
is a baby!”</p>

<p>And I went about it. On Thursday,
when he rushed over to me I could call:
“Yes, there <em>is</em> one! It’s Gabrielle’s! A
little girl, five months old and doing
beautifully!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he shouted, and hurried
back to his tons and calories.</p>

<p>It is four months since then, and I do
not know if there are any more babies,
or if that old gentleman of a distinguished
house has had any other than
this single connection with the loved ones
of this family in over two and a half
years.</p>

<p class="p110 center">THE “DROP OF MILK”</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Belgium</span> is succoring her weak
children, but she is going deeper
than this: she is trying to prevent
weak children. All through the country
there are cantines where an expectant or
young mother without means may receive
free a daily dinner, consisting usually of a
thick soup, a meat or egg dish with vegetables,
a dessert with lactogenized cream,
and a measure of milk. Light service,
like the peeling of vegetables, is often required
in return. The mother may come
as early as three months before the birth
of her child, and if she is still nursing it,
may continue nine months after its birth.
About 7,000 mothers are receiving this
dinner, and 6,000 more come to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>affiliated consultation cantines for advice.</p>

<p>Of course, there are always those who
can not nurse their children, or who can
carry them through but a short period,
when the question of pasteurized milk becomes
all-important. The “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Goutte de
Lait</span>” (drop of milk) sections meet this
problem by offering the necessary feedings
of pure milk. The mother may pay
for the bottles, and have them delivered,
or she may, if necessitous, receive them
free by calling or sending for them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="caption">A MEAL FOR YOUNG MOTHERS</p>
  </div>

<p>In Antwerp, where this work has
assumed unusual proportions, a big-hearted
president of the Belgian Provincial
Committee got permission to purchase
100 cows in Holland and to hold
them without danger of requisition. He
installed a model dairy on his place, and
now gives all the baby cantines pure
milk. He is always most anxious to finish
his arduous day’s work at the bureau,
so that he may return to his dairy, examine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>the milk tests, and review his fine
herd. One of his daughters, in addition
to hours spent in the cantines, takes the
entire responsibility of the management
of this dairy. Other towns are less fortunate,
and must struggle continually to
get the milk they require. There is a
beautiful development of the work of a
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Goutte de Lait</span>” in Hasselt, in a cantine
occupying part of a maternity hospital.
There they have an admirable equipment
for sterilization and pasteurization.
At 7 o’clock in the morning I found the
women directors already busy with the
preparation of the milk. Each feeding
has its separate bottle, and may be
kept sealed till the baby receives it. After
seven months, white phosphatine, a
mixture of the flour of wheat, rice and
corn, with salt, sugar and phosphate of
lime, is furnished; at fourteen months,
cocoa is added, and after two years, soup
and bread.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>I happened to arrive on the weekly
weighing day. One hundred mothers
were gathered in a large, cheery room,
their babies in their arms, many of them
gay in the pretty bonnets the doctor’s
wife had made for those who had the
best records. They passed, a few at a
time, into the smaller room where the
doctor and his wife examined, weighed,
counseled, while two assistants registered
important details; the three young
nurses generally aided the mothers and
their chiefs.</p>

<p>Then I was shown an adjoining room,
where, in the corners, there were heaps
of little white balls rolled in wax paper.
From a distance they looked more than
anything else like tiny popcorn balls.
What could they mean? I took one in
my hand and saw that they meant that
the most precious prize that can be
offered a Belgian mother to-day is a tiny
ball of white lard! With the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>ignorant, this prize-system is the swiftest
means of opening the way. The doctor
laughed as he recounted his struggle with
one obstinate woman, who argued stoutly
that because the cow is a great, strong
creature, while she herself is but small
and frail, undoubtedly its milk would be
infinitely more strengthening to her child
than her own! Where argument failed,
the prize convinced. If a mother can
nurse her baby but neglects to, she is
forced to feed it regularly before some
member of the committee. Nurses visit
all the homes registered.</p>

<p>The attempt is being made everywhere
to induce mothers who are not actually in
want, to enroll in these cantines, while
paying for their food, that they may have
the benefit of the pure milk and the physician’s
care. The “Relief” is not counting
the cost of this fundamental work&mdash;the
baby cantines are the promise of the
future. They are already closely watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>ing
the development of 53,000 babies.
The educational value alone can not be
measured; women who had not the faintest
conception of the simplest laws of
hygiene are being trained, forced to learn,
because their own and their children’s
food can come to them only from the
hand of their teacher. While the war has
brought unutterable misery, it has also
brought extraordinary opportunity, and
Belgium is seizing this opportunity wherever
she can.</p>

<p class="p110 center">LAYETTES</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">And</span> babies must be clothed, as well
as fed! I visited one of the Brussels
layette centers with the C. R.
B. American advisory physician, whose
interest in children had brought him at
once face to face with what women are
doing to save them. We went to a little
cantine consisting of a room and anteroom
on the ground floor, and, I might
add, the sidewalk&mdash;for before we reached
it we saw the line of hatless mothers with
their tiny babies wrapt in shawls in their
arms, waiting their turn. This was a
depot where they might receive the
articles for the lying-in period and clothing
for babies under six months of age.
We passed through the anteroom, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>a number sat nursing their babies (young
mothers mostly, and many of them
pretty), into the distributing-room.</p>

<p>Here we found three directors very
busy at their tables with the record-cards,
books and other materials of their organization,
and three younger women rapidly
sorting out the tiny bibs, slips and sheets
heaped high on the counters along the
walls. From the miscellaneous piles
they produced the neat little layettes&mdash;each
a complete wardrobe for an expectant
or young mother, and comprising
4 squares, 2 swaddling cloths, 3
fichus, 4 brassieres, 2 shirts, 2 bands, 2
pair socks, 2 bonnets, 3 bibs, 1 hooded
cloak. The packages for children from
three to six months held 3 squares, 2
pantaloons, 2 bibs, 2 fichus, 2 shirts, 2
brassieres, 2 dresses.</p>

<p>As the mothers came in, the babies
were carefully weighed and examined,
the records added to, through direct,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>effective questioning&mdash;always gentle and
encouraging. The young women turned
over the needed garments, with advice
about their use, chiefly regarding cleanliness.
To support this advice, they attempted
to have the materials white as
far as possible.</p>

<p>When I asked what they most needed,
they said, “Cradles, Madame, cradles.
We could place fifty a week in this cantine
alone, and white materials for sheets
and blankets&mdash;and oh, hundreds of yards
of rubber sheeting or its equivalent!”
For very evident reasons, the C. R. B. is
not allowed to bring in rubber materials
of any kind. Many mothers, as the babies
arrive, appeal for beds for the older children
and for mattresses for themselves.
“We can still get ticking in Brussels if
we have the money, but nothing to stuff it
with.”</p>

<p>Every morning since the beginning of
the war these women have been there, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>their feet most of the time&mdash;sorting, arranging
packages of garments, and keeping
in their minds and hearts the hundreds
of mothers and babies who depend
on them. They often visit the homes
after cantine hours. Madame smiled as
she explained the necessity of a personal
investigation of each case. “For instance,”
she said, “if at the children’s
cantine I gave a youngster a pair of shoes
simply because he seemed to have none,
and without personally proving that he
had none, I should undoubtedly have an
entire barefoot family the next day!”</p>

<p>It was with this particular kind of work
that the Petites Abeilles or “Little Bees”
started five years before the war. A group
of young women banded together to help
children, and organized centers in Brussels
for the distribution of needed clothing.
Their efforts at once won the enthusiasm
of the people. Poets wrote
songs to “The Little Bees,” the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>and the adored Princess Marie-Jos&eacute; were
their patronesses&mdash;they were probably the
most popular organization of their kind in
Belgium.</p>

<p>Then the war came, and the mothers
quickly took charge. They established a
vast home for refugees, where they
housed over 5,000. Later they appealed
to the Relief Committee to be allowed to
develop their work to meet the terrible
emergency. Their offer was only too
gladly accepted, and one after another
cantine for feeding, as well as clothing,
was opened in the various sections of the
city; where to-day practically all the work
for the children is carried on by these
wonderful “Little Bees” and their
mothers. By July, 1916, their 124 Brussels
sections were caring for about 25,000
children, and between 2,500 and 3,000
women were giving a great part of their
time to the work. Social barriers disappeared.
All classes rallied to the need.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Four hundred telephone girls out of work
were doing their best, side by side with
countesses.</p>

<p>As we were leaving, Madame explained
that the woman who founded this particular
cantine was a prisoner in Germany.
The three beautiful young girls
sorting the layettes were the daughters,
carrying forward their mother’s work.
I was to learn that almost invariably at
some moment of my visit, the veil would
be withdrawn and the tragedy revealed.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"><abbr title="14">XIV</abbr></a></h2>

<p class="p110 center">THE SKATING-RINK AT LI&Eacute;GE</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">To</span> the world Li&eacute;ge is the symbol of
Belgium’s courage. During eleven
days her forts withheld an overwhelming
force, reckless of its size or her
own unpreparedness, determined to save
the national integrity of Belgium. And
well Belgium knew to what point she
could count on the brave Li&eacute;geois;
through all her troubled history, they had
been the ardent champions of her freedom.</p>

<p>This beautiful city on the Meuse escaped
the ruin visited on other parts of
her province. In fact, all the four largest
cities of Belgium escaped, in each case a
smaller neighboring town, especially picturesque,
stands as an example of de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>struction
and warning. Belgians ask if
it was not with the obvious intent of cowing
the near-by capital, that Dinant was
made an example to Namur, Nimy to
Mons, Louvain to Brussels? They point
out that tho only the ghost of lovely
Vis&eacute;e remains, Li&eacute;ge itself has lost but
about 100 buildings. After the final inevitable
surrender of her forts, the attacking
army passed on, leaving her under
powerful control. But tho the
material damage was small, as the populous
center of a great industrial region,
this city was one of the first to realize the
distress that followed the occupation and
isolation of Belgium. One by one her
famous firearm factories and glass mills
closed their doors, and poured their thousands
of workmen into the streets. In
many cases the factories were dismantled,
the machinery taken to Germany to make
munitions. And this was happening all
through the province, so that by 1915 it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>counted 90,000 idle workmen (ch&ocirc;meurs),
and in the capital alone, fully 18,000.
Ordinarily (among her 180,000 inhabitants)
Li&eacute;ge lists 43,000 skilled workmen;
so for her the proportion of idle was almost
one-half; with their families they
represented but little less than one-quarter
of the entire population. The 4,000 employed
in the coal mines, which, fortunately,
were able to keep open, were
the one saving factor in the situation.</p>

<p>The question of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ch&ocirc;mage</span>, or unemployment,
is the most serious the relief
organization has had to face. It has
been most acute in the two Flanders; but
in Antwerp, with its 25,000 idle dock
hands, in the highly industrial Hainaut,
in Namur and Brabant, as well as in
Li&eacute;ge, there have been special circumstances
developing particular difficulties.
Over 665,000 workmen without work,
representing millions of dependents, would
present a sufficiently critical problem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>a country not at war. One can imagine
what it means to a country every square
foot of which is controlled by an enemy
so hated that the conquered would risk
all the evils of continued non-employment
rather than have any of its people serve
in any way the ends of the invader. Better
roads, better railways, mean greater
facility for the Germans.</p>

<p>None of the leaders I have talked with
have been satisfied with the system
evolved, but no one has yet been able to
substitute a better.</p>

<p>A scheduled money allowance for the
ch&ocirc;meur was quickly adopted, but as a
friend from Tournai said, this enabled a
man simply to escape complete starvation,
but not to live. Three francs a week
for the workman, one franc and a half for
his wife, fifty centimes for each of his
children, or one dollar and ten cents a
week for a family of four, just about the
war price of one pound of butter or meat!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>Obviously the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ch&ocirc;meur</span> and his family
must draw on the soupes and cantines,
and this they do. They form a considerable
part of the one and one-quarter millions
of the soup-lines. Every province
has tried to reduce its number of unemployed
by providing a certain amount of
work on roads and public utilities.
Luxembourg has been conspicuous in this
attempt, reclaiming swamps, rebuilding
sewer systems and roadways, employing
about 10,000 men. In fact, Luxembourg
has so far almost avoided a ch&ocirc;meur
class.</p>

<p>Throughout the country, too, the clothing
and lace committees are furnishing
at least partial employment to women.
In a lesser way various local relief committees
are most ingenious in inventing
opportunities to give work. In the face
of the whole big problem they often seem
insignificant, but every community is
heartened by even the smallest attempt to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>restore industry. I have seen fifty men
given the chance to buy their own food
by means of a “soles work.” All the
needy of the village were invited to bring
their worn shoes to have a new kind of
wooden sole put on for the winter, and
the men were paid by the committee for
putting them on. In one city the owner
of a closed firearm factory has opened a
toy works where 100 men and 30 women
are kept busy carving little steel boxes
and other toys. If these articles could be
exported, such establishments would
quickly multiply, but every enterprize
must halt at the grim barrier.</p>

<p>In Li&eacute;ge I came upon a most picturesque
attempt at an individual solution.
I had been much interested in Antwerp
and Charleroi and other cities, in
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D&icirc;ner Economique</span>” or “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D&icirc;ner Bourgeois</span>,”
conducted by philanthropic
women. These are big, popular restaurants,
where because of a subsidy from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>the relief committee, and because almost
all of the service is contributed, a meal
can be served for less than it costs. For
a few centimes, about ten cents, usually,
one may have a good soup, a plate with
meat and vegetables, and sometimes a
dessert.</p>

<p>Wonderful Belgian women come day
after day, month after month, to serve
the thousands that flock to these centers
that save them from the soup-lines. If
they can add this dinner to their relief
ration, they can live. And they are not
“accepting charity!” The dining-rooms
are always attractive, often bright with
flags and flowers, the women are cheery
in their service. Priests, children, artists,
men and women of every class sit at the
tables. Once I saw a poor mother buy
one dinner for herself and her two children,
and fortunately, too, I saw a swift
hand slip extra portions in front of the
little ones. There are ten such restau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>rants
in Antwerp (five conducted by the
Catholics, and five by the Liberals) that
serve on an average over 10,000 dinners
a day. The one in Charleroi serves from
400 to 900 daily.</p>

<p>In Li&eacute;ge the work is consolidated. I
found the once popular skating-rink
turned into a mighty restaurant, gay with
American bunting. The skating floor
was crowded with tables, the surrounding
spectators’ space made convenient
cloak-rooms, the one-time casual buffet
was a kitchen in deadly earnest, supplying
dinners to about 4,000 daily.</p>

<p>When I arrived, there was already a
line outside; each person had to present
a card on entering to prove him a citizen
of Li&eacute;ge. If he could, he paid 75 centimes
(15 cents) for his dinner. If unable to,
by presenting a special card from the Relief
Committee, he might receive it for
60, or even 30 centimes&mdash;a little more
than 5 cents.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p>Inside the tables were crowded, sixty-five
women were hurrying between them
and back and forth to the directors who
stood at a long counter in front of the
kitchen, serving the thousands of portions,
of soup, sausage, and a kind of
stew of rice and vegetables.</p>

<p>In the kitchen and meat and vegetable
rooms there was the constant clamor of
sifting, cutting, stirring, of the opening
and shutting of ovens. While the
sausages of the day were being hurried
from the pans, the soup of the morrow
was being mixed in the great caldrons;
250 men were hard at work. Somehow
they did not look as tho they had been
peeling carrots and stirring soup all their
lives&mdash;there was an inspiring dash in
their movements that prevented it seeming
habitual.</p>

<p>The superintendent laughed: “Yes,”
he said, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>“they are chiefly railroad engineers,
conductors, various workmen of
the Li&eacute;ge Railroad Company! I myself
was an attorney for the road, and I am
really more interested in this &oelig;uvre from
the point of view of these men, than because
of the general public it helps. Here
are 250 men who are giving their best
service to their country. In working for
others they have escaped the curse of
being forced to work for the Germans!
The sixty-five women serving the
4,000 were once in the telephone service.
They also offered to devote themselves to
their fellow-sufferers, and they are so
proud, so happy to be able to stand
shoulder to shoulder with other women in
this black hour.”</p>

<p>I asked if each worker were given his
dinner. “Ah! there was a problem!” he
said. “The meals which we furnish for
from 30 to 75 centimes, cost us an average
of 63 centimes.” To supply this to
250 assistants was quite beyond the subsidy
allowed the Relief. And yet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>workers certainly must be fed. Finally he
admitted that he and a group of friends
were contributing the money necessary to
supply these meals. He added that in the
beginning the men were hardly able to
give more than two hours’ hard work a
day, but that after a few months of
proper nourishment their energy was inexhaustible.</p>

<p>On another day I found there were no
potatoes, and that the number of meals
served had in consequence dropt fully
1,000; 743 at 75 centimes, 820 at 60
centimes, 1,473 at 30 centimes. If there
are no potatoes to be had in the city, and
they are known to be on the carte of the
restaurant, there is not standing-room.
Hundreds have to be turned away.</p>

<p>This kind of double &oelig;uvre is quite
the most interesting of all the varied attempts
to meet the staggering problem
Belgium has daily to face.</p>

<p class="p110 center">A ZEPPELIN</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">I went</span> down the road toward Verviers.
I stopt at a farmhouse to talk
with the farmer about the pitiful ration
of the Li&eacute;ge coal miners. They travel
many miles underground, and there is no
way of getting hot soup to them. His wife
gave me a glass of sweet milk. Then
we went into the courtyard where he had
a great caldron of prune syrup simmering.</p>

<p>The summer had been wet and gray,
but September was doing her best to
make up for it. Suddenly I heard the
soft whirr-whirr of a Zeppelin. I ran
out into the road. The farmer left his
prunes to join me. We watched the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>great strange thing gliding through the
sunshine. It was flying so low that we
could easily distinguish the fins, the
gondolas, the propellers. It looked more
than anything else like a gigantic, unearthly
model for the little Japanese
stuffed fishes I had often seen in the
toy shops. Its blunt nose seemed shining
white, the rest a soft gray. The effect of
the soothing whirring and its slow gliding
through the air was indescribable;
that it could be anything but a gentle
messenger of peace was unbelievable.
“Ah, Madame,” said my companion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>“four years ago <em>I</em> saw <em>my</em> first Zeppelin!
It seemed a beautiful vision from another
world, like something new in my religion.
We all stood breathless, praying
for the safety of this wonderful new
being; praying that the brave men who
conducted it might be spared to the
world. And to-day, Madame, may it be
blown to atoms; if necessary may its men
be cut to bits; may they be burned to
ashes&mdash;anything&mdash;anything! With an undying
hate I swear it shall be destroyed!
Madame, that is what war does to a man!
War, Madame, is a horrible thing!”</p>

<p class="p110 center">NEW USES OF A HIPPODROME</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> cereal and fat reserves are
divided between Rotterdam, the
mills, warehouses and moving
lighters in Belgium and Northern
France, so that one can never see the
dramatic heaping up in one place of the
grain that is to feed 10,000,000 for six
days, or months. But the greater part
of the clothing reserves are held in the
one city of Brussels. Their housing furnishes
another of the bewildering contrasts
wrought by the war; what was
two years ago a huge, thrilling Hippodrome
is now filled with the silent ranks
of bolts of cotton and flannel. And not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>far away, the once popular skating-rink
is piled to the ceiling with finished garments;
stage boxes, galleries, dressing-rooms,
stairways&mdash;all are heaped with
cases and stacked with racks. The ceiling
is the only part of the edifice still
visible; along the rear wall, for instance,
runs a big sign, “Garments for Babies,”
and they mount to the skylights. Stocks
are accumulating in both these buildings
and other sub-centers during the
summer, and in the autumn the work
of distribution against the approaching
winter begins, October 1st registering
the high-water mark of assets. At that
time there were three and a half million
pieces, yards and pairs, on the shelves
of the Hippodrome, and already hundreds
of thousands of garments assembled
in the skating-rink.</p>

<p>The Rink is not more than a few yards
and minutes from the Hippodrome, but
a bolt of flannel may travel many miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>and occupy several weeks in going from
one to the other. That journey explains
the marvelous development of the clothing
organization. One may go even
further, and trace the cloth from the
donor in America, to the recipient in
Mons or Tournai! In fact, I once
thought I recognized a finished blouse,
as plaid flannel contributed in San
Francisco. I may have been mistaken,
but I let my mind follow that flannel
from the hand of the little school-teacher
on the Pacific, to the unhappy
mother in Tournai!</p>

<p>For when the C. R. B. sent out a call
for new clothing materials in January,
1916, somehow it reached a weather-beaten
school-house on a lonely stretch
of coast 30 miles south of San Francisco.
The teacher hurriedly got together
some wool, and began showing
her eight pupils (they happened all to
be boys), how to knit caps for other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>boys of their own size. Their few families
gathered what they could, and on her
first free Saturday, the teacher started
in an open buggy in the rain for the
C. R. B. Bureau in San Francisco. This
meant 30 miles over wretched roads, up
hill and down, with her precious box.
When we opened it we found eight
knitted caps, one small sack of rice, one
pair of fur-lined gloves, a bag of beans,
a lady’s belt, plaid flannel for a blouse,
and 40 cents for eight five-cent stamps
for the letters the boys hoped to receive
in answer to those they had carefully
tucked inside the caps. They did not
know that our orders were to remove
all writing from all gifts, tho once in a
while a line did slip in. I saw a touching
example of what these slips meant
when I was leaving Brussels. A group
of women came to me to say, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>“Madame,
we hear you are going to California&mdash;is
it true? And, if you are, may we not
send a message of just a single word by
you? Will you not tell Margery Marshall,
of Saratoga, that the pretty dress she
sent over a year ago, made a little girl,
oh, so happy! She has waited all these
long months hoping to find a way to
thank Margery&mdash;and we <em>want</em> to thank
Margery. Will you tell her?”</p>

<p>These offerings then were freighted
to New York with the month’s contributions,
and there consigned to a C. R. B.
ship, starting for Rotterdam. In Rotterdam
they were unloaded into the
enormous C. R. B. clothing warehouse,
a corrugated zinc structure as big as a
city block. After the examinations,
valuings and listings, they were reloaded
on to one of the C. R. B. barges
that ply the canals constantly, and
finally deposited for the Comit&eacute; National
in the Hippodrome at Brussels.
There the women’s work began&mdash;in fact,
to one woman especially is due the credit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>for the completeness of the organization
of this clothing department.</p>

<p>On a certain day the flannel for the
blouse was piled into a big gray truck
and hauled across the city to one of the
most interesting places in Brussels.
This is at once the central workroom
for the capital, and the pattern and
model department for all Belgium.
Madame ... has 500 women and men
working continually, to prepare the
bundles of cut garments that go out to
the sub-sections and homes in Brussels.
If the seamstresses have children they
may receive one bundle of sewing a
week; if not, but one in a fortnight. In
the ouvroir itself the work is divided between
shifts who are allowed to come
for a fortnight each. This is, of course,
the great sorrow of the committees. If
only there were enough work to give all
the time to those whose sole appeal is
that they be allowed to earn their soup
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>and bread! But every hour’s work encourages
somebody, and the opportunities
are distributed just as widely as
possible. In this way about 25,000 are
reached in Greater Brussels alone.</p>

<p>The business of preparing these little
packages of cut-out blouses and trousers
and bibs is amazing. The placing of
patterns to save cloth in the cutting is
the first consideration; the counting off
of the buttons, tapes, hooks and necessary
furnishings for millions of garments&mdash;can
we conceive the tediousness
of this task? Instructions must be carefully
marked on a card that is tied across
the top of the completed bundle, everything
being made as simple for the sewer
as possible. They travel from one counter
to another, from one room to the
next, even up and down stairs, before
compact, neat and complete, they
are finally registered and ready to
go to the waiting women, who will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>make them into the skirts or baby slips
or men’s shirts or suits that the relief
committees will distribute.</p>

<p>That is the Brussels side of the work;
the national side appears in the pattern
and model department. Madame has
developed this to an extraordinary degree.
Here dozens of people are bending
over counters, folding, measuring,
cutting heavy brown paper into shapes
for every particular article that is to be
given to every particular man, baby and
woman in Belgium. There are patterns
for children of every age, and for grown-ups,
of every width and length&mdash;hundreds
of patterns for all the workrooms in all
the provinces. Then there are sample
picture-charts showing how the patterns
must be placed for the most advantageous
cutting. Along with every type of
pattern goes one finished model for exhibition
in the workroom. In the models
the women may see just how the little bundles
that started originally from the
Hippodrome should look, when they are
shipped back as garments to the Rink.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="i_144.jpg" id="i_144.jpg"></a><img src="images/i_144.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="425" />
  <p class="caption">ONE CORNER OF THE BRUSSELS HIPPODROME, NOW A CENTRAL CLOTHING SUPPLY STATION</p>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was for one of these models for
a blouse that the school-teacher’s plaid
was used! As sample blouse it traveled
from the Brussels pattern center to
an ouvroir in the Southern Hainaut:
it hung in a workroom in Mons!
After hundreds of blouses had been
copied from it and distributed in the
province, the pattern department decided
to change the blouse model, and
the old one was sent back to Brussels to
the skating-rink, to be apportioned
again, as it happened, to the relief committee
in Tournai, which knew the need
of the mother who wore it the day I
saw her! Too much system, you will
say. But there should be no such criticism
until one has seen with his own
eyes several millions depending entirely
on a relief organization for covering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>(blankets and shoes, too, are a necessary
part of the aid given), and realize the
terrible obligations to divide the work
among as many as possible of the thousands
of unemployed, the necessity of
a high standard of work, and of justice
in division among the nine provinces.</p>

<p>The scraps from the floors of the
ouvroirs are carefully hoarded in sacks,
in the hope that the Germans may grant
the committee the right to use a factory
to re-weave them into some rough materials
in the absence of cotton and wool.
Some of these cuttings are at present
being used as filling for quilts.</p>

<p>The constant contributions of time
and service at the strictly business ends&mdash;in
the warehouses, or depots like the
Hippodrome, or the skating-rink&mdash;seem
more generous than all others. In these
places the committees are shut away
from that daily contact with misery that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>evokes a quick response. The business
there has settled down to a matter of
lists and accounts: one must work with
a far vision for inspiration. It is quite
a different matter in the actual ouvroir,
where grateful women come all day and
sew, and are sometimes allowed to keep
their little children beside them. There
you have their stories and know their
suffering; you are able, also, to teach
them, while they sew, how to care for
their bodies and their homes, even to
sing, and all the while you realize that
the very garments they are putting together
are to go to others even more unhappy&mdash;these
are the places where service
has its swift and rich rewards!
I have visited just such blessed workrooms
in Namur and Charleroi and
Mons, in Antwerp and Dinant, in fact
in dozens of cities up and down the
length of Belgium. If they could be
gaily flagged as they should be, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>should see all the country dotted with
these centers of hope. And we should
know that they meant that thousands of
women in Belgium are being given at
least a few days’ work every month.</p>

<p class="p110 center">THE ANTWERP MUSIC-HALL</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Before</span> the war the big music-hall
in Antwerp offered a gay and diverting
program. Every night
thousands drifted in to laugh and smoke&mdash;drawn
by the human desire for happiness.
Here they were care-free, irresponsible;
tragedy was forgotten.</p>

<p>To-day it is still a music-hall. As
Madame opened the door&mdash;from the
floor, from the galleries, from every
part of the vast place floated a wonderful
solemn music&mdash;1,200 girls were singing
a Flemish folk-song that might have
been a prayer. We looked on a sea of
golden and brown heads bending over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>sewing tables. Noble women had rescued
them from the wreckage of war&mdash;within
the shelter of this music-hall
they were working for their lives, singing
for their souls!</p>

<p>And all the time they were preparing
the sewing and embroidery materials for
3,300 others working at home. In other
words, this was one of the blessed
ouvroirs or workrooms of Belgium.</p>

<p>Off at the left a few tailors were cutting
men’s garments. High on the
stage, crowded with packing-cases, sat
the committee of men who give all their
time to measuring the goods, registering
the income and output of materials
and finished garments. On the stage,
too, was an extraordinary exhibit. Three
forms presented three of the quaintest
silk dresses imaginable, elaborately
trimmed with ribbons and velvets and
laces, and all designed for women of
dainty figure. I laughed and then rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>flushed, as I remembered the stories of the
white satin slippers and chiffon ball gowns
that had been included in our clothing
offering of 1914. I murmured something
of apology, and referred to the
advance the Commission had made in
1915, when it had sent out the appeal for
new materials only.</p>

<p>But Madame protested: “Oh,” she
said, “these are here in honor! And we
know that somebody once loved these
dainty dresses, and for that reason gave
them to us. We love your old clothes!
Our only sadness is that we can not have
them any more. One old dress to be
made over gives work for days and days,
while the new materials can be put together
in one or two. What will become
of all my girls now that I shall have no
more of your old clothes to furnish
them? How shall they earn their 3
francs (60 cents) a week? At best we
can allow each but eight days’ work out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>of fifteen, and only one person from
each family may have this chance.”</p>

<p>“But these three dresses we shall not
touch!” And she smiled as she looked
again at her exhibit.</p>

<p>Here the whole attitude toward the
clothing is from the point of view, not
of the protection it gives, but of the employment
it offers. Without this employment,
without the daily devotion of the
wonderful women who have built up
this astonishing organization, thousands
of other women must have been
on the streets&mdash;with no opportunity
(except the dread, ever present one)
through these two years to earn a franc,
with nothing but the soup-lines to depend
on for bread. Of course, there is
always dire need for the finished garments.
They are turned over as fast as
they can be to the various other committees
that care for the destitute. Between
February, 1915, and May, 1916,
articles valued at over 2,000,000 francs
were given out in this way through this
ouvroir alone.</p>

  <p class="caption">THE ANTWERP MUSIC-HALL, NOW A SEWING-ROOM</p>
  <p class="center">Here hundreds of women are being saved, by
   being furnished the opportunity to work two weeks in
   each month, on an average wage of sixty cents a week</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>But one could endure cold&mdash;anything
is better than the moral degradation
following long periods of non-employment.
So it is not of the garments,
but of the 9,500,000 francs dispensed as
wages, that these women think. The
work <em>must</em> go on. “See,” Madame said,
“what we do with the veriest scraps!”
A young woman was putting together
an attractive baby quilt. She had four
pieces of an old coat, large enough to
make the top and lining, and inside she
was stitching literally dozens of little
scraps of light woolen materials. Another
was making children’s shoes out
of bits of carpet and wool.</p>

<p>In one whole section the girls do nothing
but embroider our American flour
sacks. Artists draw designs to represent
the gratitude of Belgium to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>United States. The one on the easel as
we passed through, represented the lion
and the cock of Belgium guarding the
crown of the king, while the sun&mdash;the
great American eagle&mdash;rises in the East.
The sacks that are not sent to America
as gifts are sold in Belgium as souvenirs.
Each sack has its value before being
worked. Many of them&mdash;especially in
the north of France&mdash;have been made
into men’s shirts, and tiny babies’ shirts
and slips.</p>

<p>Before July, 1916, in the Charleroi
ouvroir, over 30,000 sacks had been
made into 15,000 shirts at a cost of 25
centimes per sack, and a sewing price of
30 centimes each.</p>

<p>Each Monday the women may work
on their own garments, and on Tuesday
all the poor of the city bring their clothing
to be patched or darned. A shoe section,
too, does what it can for old shoes.
Such shoes and such remnants of socks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>and of shirts as we saw! But the more
difficult the job, the happier the committee!</p>

<p>During the week, courses are given in
the principles of dressmaking and design.
In the evening there are classes
for history, geography, literature, writing,
and very special attention is given
to hygiene, which is taught by means of
the best modern slides. These things
are splendid, and with the three francs
a week wages, spell self-respect, courage,
progress all along the line. The
committee has always been able to secure
the money for the wages, but they
can not possibly furnish the materials&mdash;sufficient
new ones they could never
have.</p>

<p>They are living from day to day on
the hope that the C. R. B. may be able
to make an exception for the Antwerp
ouvroir, and appeal once more for her
precious necessity&mdash;“old clothes!” This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>the C. R. B. may be able to do&mdash;but will
England feel equally free to make an exception
to her ruling that since the Germans
have taken the wool from the
Belgian sheep, no clothing of any kind
can be sent in?</p>

<p>As I was leaving, a thrilling thing
happened. Picture this sea of golden
and brown heads low over the heaped
tables&mdash;every square foot of pit, galleries
and entry packed, lengths of cotton
and flannel flung in confusion over
all the balconies and from the royal box
like war banners&mdash;and then suddenly
see a man making his way through the
crowded packing-cases on the stage to
the footlights! He was the favorite
baritone of this one-time concert hall,
and he has come (as he does twice a
week) to stand in the midst of the packing-cases
behind his accustomed footlights
to sing to this audience driven in
by disaster, and to teach them the beau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>tiful
Flemish folk-songs. They sing as
they work. For several minutes neither
Madame nor I spoke. Then she smiled
swiftly and said: “Yes, it is sadly beautiful&mdash;and
you know, incidentally, it prevents
much idle chatter!”</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"><abbr title="18">XVIII</abbr></a></h2>

<p class="p110 center">LACE</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">A full</span> account of the struggle of
the lace-workers would take us
straight to the heart of the tragedy
of Belgium. At present it can only
be intimated. The women who are back
of this struggle represent a fine intelligence,
a most fervent patriotism and
most unswerving devotion to their people
and their country.</p>

<p>Before the war, her laces were the
particular pride of Belgium. Flanders
produced, beside the finest linen, the most
exquisite lace known. The Queen took
this industry under her especial patronage
and tried in every way to better
the condition of the workers, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>raise the standard of the output. We
need to remember that when war broke
out, 50,000 women were supporting
themselves, and often their families,
through this work; we need to remember
the suddenness with which the steel
ring was thrown about Belgium&mdash;all import
of thread, all export of lace, at once
and entirely cut off. In a few weeks,
in a few days, thousands of women were
without hope of earning their bread&mdash;at
least in the only way hitherto open to
them. The number grew with desperate
swiftness. And we need most of all
to remember that the chief lace centers
were in the zone under direct military
rule.</p>

<p>Women like Madame ... grappled with
this situation, trying to save their workers
(most of them young girls) from the
dread alternative, trying by one means and
another to give them heart, and hoping
always that America could make a way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>for them, till finally that hope was
realized&mdash;the C. R. B. had gained the
permission of England to bring in a certain
amount of thread, and to take out a
corresponding amount of lace for sale in
France and England, or elsewhere.</p>

<p>A fever of effort followed. Everywhere
those who had been trying to
keep the groups of lace-workers alive
were given thread. They organized centers
for the control of the output. The
thread must be weighed as it was given
out, and paid for by the worker as a
guaranty that it would not be sold to
some one else; the weight of the lace
turned in must tally. Much thought
must be put in the selection of designs,
into the choice of articles to be made&mdash;things
that would interest the people of
England and France and America.</p>

<p class="space-above"></p>
<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="caption">THE SUPPLEMENTARY MEAL THE
RELIEF COMMITTEE IS NOW TRYING TO GIVE TO
1,250,000 SCHOOL CHILDREN</p>
  </div>

<p>Certain parts and kinds of these laces
are made in certain districts only. I am
told that the very fine Malines lace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>made now only in a restricted area, will
not be found much longer. All these
separate parts must be brought to the
central depot to be made into tea-cloths
and doilies and other articles for export.
The finest and most necessary laces and
the linen for the cloths are made in or
about Bruges and Courtrai and in other
towns in Flanders, in what is known as
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&Eacute;tape</span>,” or zone of military preparation,
with which it is almost impossible
to communicate.</p>

<p>The C. R. B. is made absolutely responsible
to England that no lace will
be sold in the open market in the occupied
territory (altho it was allowed to
be sold in October and November, 1915,
at exhibitions in several of the large
cities of Belgium), and that all of it be
exported. If it is not sold, it must be
held at Rotterdam.</p>

<p>One can imagine the meaning of the
first export of lace to those whose hearts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>were in this work. It was not only that
they saw the lace-workers kept alive, but
they saw their country reunited with
the outside world. Her beautiful laces
were going to those who would buy
them eagerly, her market would be kept
open.</p>

<p>Of necessity, the work became
strongly centralized. The Brussels bureau,
where three noble women especially
were giving literally every day of
their time and every particle of their
energy and talent, became the official
headquarters, and 45,000 lace-workers
were employed under orders sent out by
this central committee. Every day they
came to plan, to design, to direct. They
were handling thousands of articles,
and hundreds of thousands of francs.
They carefully examined every yard
sent in, rejecting any piece below the
standard, encouraging excellence in
every possible way. Never in recent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>times have there been such beautiful
laces made, and they are being sold at
about half what was asked before the
war. Many of the designs are copies of
the best ancient models, other lovely
ones turn on the present situation, having
for motive the roses of the Queen,
the arms of the provinces, the animals
of the Allies.</p>

<p>Madame ... made an unforgettable
picture&mdash;tall, golden-haired, exquisite, arranging
and re-arranging the insets for
her cloths and cushions&mdash;and recounting,
as she set her patterns, the steps in the
struggle for the lace-workers. There
had been dangers, some were in prison.
As I listened I felt the fire within must
consume her. I understood why there
were women in prison, why martyrdom
was always a near and real possibility.</p>

<p>There were always discouragements
of one kind or another. At the bureau,
one day, Madame’s eyes were red when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>she came downstairs. She had just had
to turn off a group of workers; there
was no thread to give them. At best,
in order that all may be helped a little,
no one person may work more than 30
hours a week, nor receive more than 3
francs (or 60 cents) a week as wages!</p>

<p>But on the whole the lace committees
are overwhelmingly grateful for the opportunities
they have had. Up to
November, 1916, they have dispensed
6,000,000 francs in wages. They have
given two weeks’ work a month to
45,000 women, 25,000 of whom are
skilled, 10,000 of average ability, and
10,000 beginners. There will be a deficit
when the war is over. “But what
of that?” they say, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>“if only we can keep
on! On the Great Day we shall give
back to the Queen her chosen industry,
fully three years ahead of where she left
it. She will find all the standards raised,
her women better trained and equipped
to care for themselves, and to re-establish
Belgium as the lace-maker of the
world.”</p>

<p>It has been extremely difficult for the
C. R. B. to handle the lace in the United
States. Its great value necessitates
much more machinery and time than
could be spared from the all-important
ravitaillement duty. The orders from
England and France are much easier to
take care of. On one happy day Paquin
wrote for all the Point de Paris
and Valenciennes they could supply.
Certain friends in London and New
York are every now and then sending
in individual requests. On a red-letter
day the Queen of Roumania ordered,
through her Legation, three very beautiful
table-cloths, and quantities of other
fine laces. And it is the hope of the
committee that the number of these
friends will grow. Needless to say,
hardly a C. R. B. representative leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Belgium without taking with him
some example of this exquisite work, a
testimony to others of the splendid devotion
of the women of these lace committees.</p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"><abbr title="19">XIX</abbr></a></h2>

<p class="p110 center">A TOY FACTORY</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">I was</span> reminded again to-day of how
constant work must be the only thing
that makes living possible to many of
these women. We were at lunch, when
suddenly the roar of the German
guns cut across our talk. We rushed
into the street, where a gesticulating
crowd had already located the five
Allied aeroplanes high above us. Little
white clouds dotted the sky all about
them&mdash;puffs of white smoke that
marked the bursting shrapnel. Tho the
guns seemed to be firing just behind our
house, we believed we were quite out of
danger. However, Marie ran to us quite
white and with her hands over her ears.
“Oh, Madame!” she cried, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>“the shrapnel
is bursting all about the kitchen!”
She had experienced it. She had told
me once that her sister had died of fright
three days after the war began, and I
realized now that she probably had.
Our picturesque L&eacute;on slipt over to
assure me that this was not a real attack,
but just a visit to give us hope on the
second anniversary of the beginning of
the war, to tell us the Allies were thinking
of us, and that we should soon be
delivered. Without doubt they would
drop a message of some sort.</p>

<p>I thought of our United States Minister
and his proximity to the Luxembourg
railroad station. He had several
times smilingly exprest concern over
that proximity.</p>

<p>I remembered, too, the swift answer
of Monsieur ... who lives opposite the
railroad station at Mons. Bombs had
just been dropt on this station&mdash;one had
fallen in front of his house, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>I asked if he and his wife would not consider
moving he replied, “Madame, our
two sons are in the trenches&mdash;should we
not be ashamed to think of this as
danger?”</p>

<p>All the while the aeroplanes were
circling and the guns were booming.
Then suddenly one of the aviators made
a sensational drop to within a few hundred
meters of the Molenbeek Station,
threw his bombs, and before the guns
could right themselves, regained his
altitude&mdash;and all five were off, marvelously
escaping the puffs of white before
and behind them.</p>

<p>This was thrilling, till suddenly
flashed the sickening realization of what
it really meant. The man behind the
gun was doing his utmost to kill the
man in the machine. It was horrible&mdash;horrible
to us.</p>

<p>But to Belgian wives and mothers
what must it have been? As they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>looked up they cried: “Is that my boy&mdash;my
husband, who has come back to
his home this way? After two years,
is he there? My God, can they reach
him?” The only answer was the roar
of the guns, the bursting shrapnel&mdash;and
they covered their eyes.</p>

<p>I visited Madame ..., whose only son
is in the flying corps, at her toy factory
the following day, and realized what
the experience had cost her. Her comment,
however, was, “Well, now I believe
I am steeled for the next.”</p>

<p>Madame is accomplishing one of the
finest pieces of work being done in Belgium
to-day. Before the war she had
a considerable reputation as a painter
in water colors. As suddenly as it came,
she found her home emptied of sons,
brothers, nephews, and she went
through the common experience of trying
to construct something from the
chaos of those tragic days. Her first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>thought was of what must be done for
the little nephews and nieces who were
left. They must be kept happy as well as
alive. And she wondered if she could not
turn her painting to use in making toys
for them. Often before the war when
sketching in Flanders she had looked at
the quaint old villages, full of beauty in
color and line, and felt that each was a
jewel in itself and ought, somehow, to be
preserved as a whole. And suddenly she
decided to try and reproduce them in
toy form for children. She drew beautiful
designs of the villages of Furnes
and Dixmude, loving ones of churches
that had already been destroyed. She
secured wood, began carving her houses,
trees, furniture&mdash;then arranged her villages,
drawing the patterns for the children
to build from. Needless to say the
nieces and nephews were enchanted;
and she worked ahead on other villages
for other children.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>Not very long after this she visited
the Queen’s ambulance in the palace at
Brussels, and as she talked with the
wounded Belgian soldiers, the thought
of the hopeless future of the mutilated
ones tormented her. It suddenly flashed
over her that they might be given hope,
if they could be taught to make her beloved
toys. She was allowed to bring
in models&mdash;the soldiers were interested
at once&mdash;the authorities gave her permission
to teach them.</p>

<p>Later she secured a building in Brussels&mdash;her
sister-in-law and others of her
family came to help. They wisely laid
in a good supply of beechwood in advance,
got their paints and other materials
ready, and began to work with a
handful of soldiers. She soon needed
machines for cutting the wood, and then
found that no matter how thoroughly
healed, a man who has been terribly
wounded, the equilibrium of whose body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>had been destroyed by the loss of an
arm or leg, or both, could not soon be
trusted with a dangerous machine&mdash;and
she had to engage a few expert workmen
for this department. Girls begged
to be taken in, and she added nine to her
fifty soldiers&mdash;one of them a pretty,
black-haired refugee from the north of
France. The thick book with all the addresses
of applicants for work who have
had to be refused, is a mute evidence of
the saddest part of this whole situation&mdash;the
lack of work for those who beg to
be kept off the soup-lines.</p>

<p>The fortunate ones are paid by piece-work,
but always the directors try to
arrange that each man shall be able to
earn about 2½ francs a day.</p>

<p>Madame is not merely accomplishing
a present palliative, but aiming at making
men self-respecting, useful members
of the State for their own and their
country’s good.</p>

<p class="p110 center">ANOTHER TOY FACTORY</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> following day, I visited another
kind of toy factory.
Madame ..., who had lost her
only son early in the war, works probably
in the most inconvenient building in
Brussels, which she has free of charge.
She works there all day long, every day,
furnishing employment for between 30
and 40 girls, who would otherwise have
to be on the soupes. I went from one
room to another, where they were busily
constructing dolls, and animals, and all
sorts of fascinating toys out of bits of
cotton and woolen materials&mdash;cheap,
salable toys.</p>

<p>This is one of the things that we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>remember if we wish properly to appreciate
the work the women are doing&mdash;most
of it is being carried on in buildings
that we should consider almost impossible&mdash;no
elevators; everywhere the
necessity of climbing long flights of
stairs; no convenient sanitary arrangements&mdash;but
nothing discourages them.</p>

<p>Madame began by making bouncing
balls in the Belgian colors, stuffed with
a kind of moss. They cost only a few
centimes, and sold as fast as she could
make them. When the order came that
they were no longer to be made in these
colors, she ripped up those she had on
hand, and began new ones, omitting the
black. The balls must go on. Another
day all the stuffing for her balls was
requisitioned. She rushed out, up and
down, street after street, seeking a substitute,
and by night the little storeroom
was filled with a kind of dry grass&mdash;and
the balls could go on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>The day of my first visit there were
6 of the 32 girls absent because of
illness. Madame said she usually had
that large a percentage out because of
intestinal troubles of one sort or another.
They get desperately tired of
their monotonous food, and whenever
they can scrape together a few extra
pennies, they go to one of the few chocolate
shops still open and make themselves
ill.</p>

<p>Here, too, they are looking to America.
If only they could get their toys
to our markets, they could take in many
who are suffering for want of work&mdash;and
one feels that America would be
delighted with every toy.</p>

<p>It is Madame herself who designs
them. She is trying always to get something
new, striking. In the C. R. B.
office one day I noticed a representative
off in a corner, busy with his pencil, and
found him struggling to represent some
sort of balancing bird&mdash;a suggestion for
Madame.</p>

  <p class="caption">TOYS CREATED BY WOMEN OF BELGIUM</p>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>She makes these lovely toys from the
veriest scraps of cloth, old paper, straw,
with pebbles picked up from the roads
for weights.</p>

<p>In the beginning she knew nothing at
all about such work, nor did any one of
the young girls she was trying to help.
But such a spirit experiments! She ground
newspapers in a meat-grinder to try to
evolve some kind of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;. She
learned her processes by producing
things with her own hands, and then
taught each woman as she employed
her. Thus she, too, is not only keeping
her corps from the present soup-line, but
preparing a body of trained workers
for the future. The shops in Brussels
sell these toys&mdash;a few have reached as
far as Holland.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Belgium one is imprest
with the facility in the handling of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>color, of clay or wood. There is the
most unusual feeling for decorative
effect; the tiniest children in the schools
show a striking aptitude for design and
modeling, and an astonishing sense of
rhythm. One is constantly struck by
this; it is a delight to hear a group of
three-year olds carrying an intricate
song without accompaniment, as they
go through the figures of a dance.</p>

<p class="p110 center">THE MUTIL&Eacute;S</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">At</span> last I met the little Madame&mdash;all
nerve, energy&mdash;a flame flashing
from one plant under her charge
to the next. I had seen her whirling by
in a car, one of the two Belgian women
allowed a limited pass. I had heard how
she presided over councils of men, as
well as of women; that she had won the
admiration of all. With her it is not a
question of how many hours she spends;
she gives literally every hour of her
time. It was especially of her work for
the mutilated victims of the war that we
talked this morning. She took me to
the park at Woulwe, where she has 180
men being trained in various trades.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>Ten months ago she decided that one
of the most important things Belgium
had to accomplish was to save its mutilated
for themselves and the State. The
whole problem of the unemployment
brought on by the war was terrific. In
April, 1916, over 672,000 workmen were
idle. But the mutilated soldiers formed
the most heartbreaking part of this
problem. They must at once be taught
trades that would fill their days and
make them self-supporting in the future.</p>

<p>First of all, their surroundings must
be cheerful and healthy; no cramped
buildings in the city, and yet something
easily accessible from Brussels. She
told me how she searched the environs
until she came upon an old, apparently
deserted villa at Woulwe with beautiful
spacious grounds, orchard and vegetable
garden. She quickly sought out the
owner and appealed to him to turn his
property over to the “Mutil&eacute;s.” In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>three days a letter told her the request
was granted, and within a few hours an
architect was at work on the plans. He
developed a cottage system with everything
on one floor, sleeping-rooms,
workrooms, unlimited fresh air and
light; the most modern sanitary equipment;
and for the workrooms, every
practical arrangement possible. There
is a gymnasium with a resident physician
directing the work. His duty is
one of the most difficult; it is not easy
to convince the men of the value of all
the bothersome exercises he prescribes.
The restoration of the equilibrium of
their broken bodies is to them often a
vague end. At first some even try to
escape using the artificial arms and legs
provided them.</p>

<p>The cottages are grouped about the
garden, under the trees, connected by
easy little paths for the lame and the
blind. The old villa holds the office,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>the dining-room, and a big, airy pavilion,
where the men may gather for a
weekly entertainment, cards or music.
A bowling alley has been converted
into the quaintest little chapel imaginable,
with the Virgin Mary and the
statues of the King and Queen in very
close company, and back of them a
splendid Belgian flag. Besides the regular
gatherings, the men hold special
services here for their comrades dead on
the Field of Honor.</p>

<p>One by one new cottages are being
built; more trades are being taught.
Electricity and book-binding have been
added recently, and the course for chauffeurs.
The greater number of the men
work in the shoe shops, where there is
one workroom for the Walloons and
another for the Flemings; but the scarcity
of leather greatly hinders this important
department. In certain sections
they are already using machinery manu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>factured
by the men themselves. And
it must be kept in mind all the time that
these men before the war were almost
without exception in the fields.</p>

<p>Madame told us that the most cheerful
workmen are the blind, who seemed,
however, most to be pitied, as they sat
there weaving their baskets and chair
seats. She said that often during their
weekly entertainments the entire company
would be thrown into spasms of
laughter by the sudden meowing of cats
or cackling of hens in their midst. These
were the tricks of the blind men, who
were as gay as children.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</i> is truly a joyous place, set
in a garden tended by the soldiers, and
inside flooded with light. The walls are
covered with models and designs. Some
of the men were busy with patterns for
lace and embroidery. Others were
modeling. A legless soldier, in the
trenches only a month ago, was already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>handling his clay with pleasure and skill.
But the most remarkable work was that
of a man who had lost his right arm.
Before the war, like the others, he had
been a “cultivateur,” never conscious of
a talent that under the encouragement
of a good teacher was developing astonishingly.
With the pencil in his left hand,
he produced designs of leaves, flowers
and animals of great beauty.</p>

<p>One of the strangest, saddest sights
in the world is the workroom for artificial
limbs. Here men who have lost
their own arms and legs sit constructing
arms and legs for their comrades
who are to lose theirs on the battlefield.
A soldier who had his right arm and all
but two fingers of his left hand shot
away, was filing, hammering, and shaping
an artificial arm. A man with half
of each forearm gone was able, by means
of a simple leather appliance, to make
thirty-five brushes a day. Here they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>were making, too, the gymnasium apparatus
for the muscular exercises which
help to restore the equilibrium of their
own bodies.</p>

<p>After visiting all the workshops, we
went to one of the cheery cottage dormitories.
It was noon-time now, and
the men, deciding that we were apt to
pass that way, had quickly decorated
the front porch with the flags of the
Allies, daringly binding our American
flag with them! Then with a yellow
sand they had written on the darker
earth in front of the cottage: “To the
Welcome Ones&mdash;the Brave Allies”&mdash;(again
they had included us!) “we offer
the gratitude of their soldiers!”</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"><abbr title="22">XXII</abbr></a></h2>

<p class="p110 center">THE LITTLE PACKAGE</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">One</span> morning in Antwerp I saw
women with string bags filled
with all sorts of small packages,
some with larger boxes in their arms,
hurrying toward a door over which was
the sign “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Petit Paquet</span>”&mdash;the Little
Package. In the hallway many others
were trying to decipher various posted
notices. One black-haired woman,
empty bag in hand, was going through
the list marked “Kinds and quantities
of food allowed in ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Petit Paquet</span>’
for our soldiers, prisoners in Germany.”</p>

<p>This, then told the story&mdash;husbands
and sons were in prison&mdash;wives and
mothers were here! The posted notices,
the organizations within achieved by 24
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>devoted women&mdash;the mountains of little
brown packages each carefully addrest,
approved for contents and weight, and
ready for shipment&mdash;these connected
the two sad extremes.</p>

<p>This morning the receiving-room was
crowded, as it is every morning, I am
told. The directors had been standing
back of the long counters since 7:30;
women of every class pressing along
the front, depositing their precious
offerings.</p>

<p>Each prisoner is allowed a monthly
500-gram parcel-post package, and a 10-pound
box, which may contain, beside
food, tobacco and clothing. The permitted
articles include cocoa, chocolate
and coffee; tinned fish and vegetables
and soups; powdered milk and jam.
Soap may be sent with the clothing.
One mother had arranged her parcels in
a pair of wooden sabots which she hoped
to have passed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>Such a rush of unwrapping, weighing,
re-wrapping. There seemed hardly a
moment for breathing, and yet somehow
there was time to listen to stories, to
answer questions, give courage to hundreds
who found in these rooms their
closest connection with their loved ones.
One could see that they were loath to
go&mdash;they would have liked to stay and
watch the final wrapping and registering&mdash;to
actually <em>see</em> their tokens to the
train!</p>

<p>On this day there was a special gift
box from Cardinal Mercier for every
prisoner from the province. Antwerp
has 6,000 prisoners in Germany, and
through the offerings of relatives or
friends, or of the city itself when these
fail, each one receives a permitted gift.</p>

<p>One sees at a glance what an enormous
task the bookkeeping alone entails&mdash;record
of contents, addresses of
senders, distribution, registering of re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>ceived
packages, and numberless other
entries. And each month the instructions
are changing, which renders the
work still more arduous.</p>

<p>And one is astonished over and over
again at the amount of sheer physical
energy women are putting into their
service. Belgium has some 40,000 prisoners
in Germany. In Brussels and
other cities other women are repeating
what the directors in Antwerp were doing
that morning.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"><abbr title="23">XXIII</abbr></a></h2>

<p class="p110 center">THE GREEN BOX</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> are seven rooms in Brussels,
each with a long table in the
middle, and with rows upon rows
of green wooden boxes (about the size
of a macaroni box) on shelf-racks
against walls. The racks, too, are
painted the color of hope&mdash;the green
which after the war might well deserve
a place with the red, orange and black,
for having so greatly comforted the people
when all display of their national
colors was supprest. Each box has a
hook in front from which hangs a pasteboard
card, marked with a number; it
hangs there if the box is full, when
empty it is filed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>The first morning I happened in on
one of these sections, I found a director
and three pretty young girls feverishly
busy with hundreds and hundreds of
little paper bags. There were as many
green boxes as the table would hold,
arranged before them, with scales at
either end. They were running back
and forth from the pantry with a bowl
or an apronful of something, and then
weighing and pouring into the bags
tiny portions of beans and chicory, salt
and sugar, bacon and other things.
They weighed and poured as fast as they
could and with almost joyous satisfaction
tucked the little bags one after another
into the boxes. Then they dove
into the big vegetable baskets at one end
of the room, and each box was made gay
with a lettuce or cauliflower. For some
there were bottles of milk, or a few precious
potatoes or eggs. If the egg chest
had been gold, it could hardly have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>more treasured. For a moment it
seemed the war must be a horrible
dream. This was really the day before
Christmas! There were even a few red
apples&mdash;as a special surprize, some one
had contributed two kilos that day.
Since they were obviously far short of
enough to furnish one for each box, the
directors decided to tuck one into the
box for each mother whom they knew
to have a little boy or girl. Box after
box took its place on the shelves until
finally, by two o’clock, all gaps were
filled, and a curious wall-garden grew
half-way up to the ceiling. It might well
have been Christmas, but actually this
scene had been repeated two days a
week, week in and week out, for over
two and a half years, and nobody stops
to question how many long months it
must continue.</p>

<p>Some time before the last box was on
its shelf, the first woman with a string
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>bag on her arm arrived. She was carefully
drest, intelligent-looking, a woman
of about fifty. Later I found that before
the war she had a comfortable
home, with servants and a motor-car.
She slipt quietly along the racks till she
found the card with her number, took
her box from the shelf and transferred
the tiny sacks and the two eggs to her
string bag. Then she placed the little
packet of empty bags and string she
was returning on the table, and, after
answering a few questions about her
two children, went slowly downstairs.
None but the Committee, or equally unfortunate
ones who came as she did,
need know she had been there. This
was Wednesday; she could come again
on Friday. Other women came, and, as
the first, each could go to her box without
asking, and find the precious packages&mdash;mere
mouthfuls as they seemed
to me!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>I thought I smelled soup, and followed
Madame ... to a little side room
where I saw chairs and a white-covered
table. Her cook was just depositing a
big can of thick soup which she had been
preparing at home, and which Madame
had ordered brought to the center each
distribution day. Any one who wishes
may slip into this room on her way out,
sit at a dainty table, and drink a bowl
of hot soup.</p>

<p>By half-past two the place was filled.
Dozens of women were busy with their
bags and boxes, while half a dozen directors
were tidying up, storing strings
and sacks, filing cards, washing utensils;
there was a most heartening atmosphere
of busyness and cheerfulness. And all
the while one group was telling its story
to the other and receiving the comfort
warm hearts could give. I overheard the
promise of a bed to one, or coal to
another, and over and over again the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>“Yes, I understand; I, too, am without
news.” From all the husbands and sons
at the front no word! These women met
on the ground of their common suffering.
One of the saddest of all sad things
happened that afternoon, when a mother,
on seeing the lovely “unnecessary” apple,
burst into tears. For so long, so long,
her little Marie had had nothing but the
ration prescribed to keep her from starving.
This mother broke down as she
dropt the red apple into her bag.</p>

<p>These were all people who had been
well-off, even comfortable, but whose
funds either suddenly, at the beginning,
or gradually through the two terrible
years, had been exhausted. Mostly their
men were in the trenches; there were
children or old people to care for; they
had done their utmost, but at last were
forced to accept help. I wondered how
these few pitiful little bags could make
any difference. The slice of unsmoked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>bacon was neither so broad nor so thick
as the palm of my hand, and yet that
was to be their meat and butter for three
days! In this distribution center it
seemed absolutely nothing, but when I
visited the homes later I saw it was a
great deal.</p>

<p>In Brussels there were in October,
1916, no less than 5,000 “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauvres Honteux</span>”
or “Ashamed Poor” (there must be
many more now) being helped through
the seven sections of this “Assistance
Discr&egrave;te,” each of which carries the same
beautiful motto, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Donne, et tais-toi</span>,”
“Give, and be silent.” At the very beginning
of the war a great-hearted
woman saw where the chief danger of
misery lay. The relief organizations
would naturally first look after the
wounded, the homeless, the very poor.
Those who were accustomed to accept
charity would make the earliest demands.
But what about those whose business was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>slowly being ruined, whose reserves were
small? What about school-teachers,
artists, and other members of professional
classes? And widows living on
securities invested abroad, or children of
gentle upbringing, whose fathers had
gone to the front expecting to return in
three or four months? She saw many
of them starving rather than go on the
soup-lines.</p>

<p>She had a vision of true mutual aid.
Each person who had should become the
sister of her who had not. There should
be a sharing of individual with individual.
She did not think of green boxes or sections,
but of person linked with person
in the spirit of Fraternity. But the number
of the desperate grew too rapidly,
her first idea of direct individual help
had to be abandoned, and one after
another distribution centers were organized.
An investigator was put in charge
of each center who reported personally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>on all the cases that were brought in,
either directly or indirectly to the committee.
The Relief Committee granted a
subsidy of 10,000 francs a month, which,
one sees at a glance, can not nearly cover
the need. So day after day the directors
of each section canvass their districts for
money and food, and by dint of an untiring
devotion raise the monthly 10,000
to about 28,000 francs. But, unfortunately,
every day more of war means
wretched ones forced to the wall, and
this sum is always far from meeting the
distress. We have only to divide the
30,000 francs by the 5,000 on the lists,
to see what, at best, each family may receive.</p>

<p>I went with Mademoiselle ..., an investigator,
to visit one of these families.
A charming old gentleman received us.
I should say he was about seventy-three.
He had been ill, and was most cheerful
over what he called his “recovery,” tho
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>to us he still looked far from well. The
drawing-room was comfortable, spotlessly
clean; there was no fire. We
talked of his children, both of whom were
married; one son was in Italy, another in
Russia&mdash;the war had cut off all word
or help from both. He himself had been
a successful engineer in his day, but he
had not saved much, his illness and two
years of war had eaten up everything.
He was interested in Mexico and in the
Panama Canal, and we chatted on until
Mademoiselle felt we must go. As we
were shaking hands, she opened her black
velvet bag and took out an egg which
she laughingly left on the table as her
visiting card. She did it perfectly, and
he laughed back cheerily, “After the
war, my dear, I shall certainly find the
hen that will lay you golden eggs!”
Outside, I still could hardly pull myself
together&mdash;one egg as a precious gift to a
dignified old gentleman-engineer! Could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>it be possible? “But,” explained Mademoiselle,
“if I had not given him that
egg, he would not have any egg!” Eggs
were costing about ten cents each. “Of
course, we never even discuss meat,” she
added; “but he has been quite ill, and he
must have an egg at least every two or
three days!”</p>

<p>The woman we visited next did not
have a comfortable home, but a single
room. She had been for many years a
governess in a family in Eastern Belgium,
but just before the war both she
and the family had invested their money
in a savings concern which had gone to
pieces, and from that day she had been
making the fight to keep her head above
water. She had come to Brussels, was
succeeding fairly well, when she was taken
ill. She had had an operation, but after
months there was still an open wound, and
she could drag herself about only with
great difficulty. I found that Mademoiselle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>takes her to the hospital, a matter of hours,
three times a week for treatment, and, besides
that, visits her in her room. As we
were talking, a niece, also unfortunately
without funds, came in to polish the stove
and dust a bit. Mademoiselle reported
that she was pretty sure of being able to
bring some stockings to knit on her next
visit. These would bring five cents a
pair. And, as we left, she gave another
egg, and this time a tiny package of
cocoa, too. I discovered that every
morsel this governess has to eat comes to
her from Mademoiselle. And yet I have
never been in a room where there was
greater courage and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>So it was as we went from square to
square. In some homes there were children
with no father; in others, grandfathers
with neither children nor grandchildren;
and between them, people well
enough, young enough, but simply ruined
by the war. Mademoiselle was going back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>to spend the night with an old lady we
had visited the week before, and had
found reading Anatole France. She
had felt she must make her last testament,
and looking at her we agreed.
That week she had received word that
her only son, who was also her only kin,
had been killed in the trenches three
months before.</p>

<p>Of course, every city has its hundreds
of unfortunates; there must be everywhere
some form of “Assistance Discr&egrave;te,”
but most of those on the lists of
this war-time organization would in
peace time be the ones to give, rather
than receive, and their number is increasing
pitifully as month follows month.</p>

<p>Every one permitted to be in Belgium
for any length of time marvels at the incredible,
unbreakable spirit of its people.
They meet every new order of the military
authorities with a laugh; when they
have to give up their motor-cars, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>ride on bicycles; when all bicycle tires are
requisitioned, they walk cheerfully; if the
city is fined 1,000,000 marks, the laconic
comment is: “It was worth it!” All the
news is censored, so they manufacture
and circulate cheerful news&mdash;nothing ever
breaks through their smiling, defiant
solidarity. One thing only in secret I
have heard them admit, and that is the
anguish of their complete separation from
their loved ones at the front. Mothers
and wives of every other nation may have
messages; they, never.</p>

<p>The thing that has bound them thus
together and buoyed them up is just this
enveloping, inter-penetrating atmosphere
of mutual aid, so beautifully exprest
every day through the work of the “Assistance
Discr&egrave;te.” It was this vision of
Fraternity in its widest sense that gave
it birth, and every day the women of
Belgium are making that vision a blessed
reality.</p>

endless complications to be
straightened out, figures and reports to
be accepted or rejected&mdash;with all the unimaginable
difficulties incident to the relief
of an occupied territory.</p>

<p>Responsible on the one hand to England,

always on the continued active

literally inch by inch and hour by hour

BY THE WAR, WAITING FOR THEIR DINNER</p>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>It is easy to conceive of such service if
the giver is in close touch with the mother
and her need, but when he must be cut
off from her&mdash;locked up with the grind,
the disillusionment, the staggering obstacles,
this unbroken devotion through the
days and nights of more than two years,
becomes one of the finest expressions of
altruism the world has seen.</p>

<p>The two years have left their mark&mdash;to
strangers he must seem silent, grim, but
every C. R. B. man knows what this
covers.</p>

<p>On one visit I persuaded him to take
an hour from the bureau to go with me
to one of the cantines for sub-normal
children. He stood silently as the 1,600
little boys and girls came crowding in,
slipping in their places at the long, narrow
tables that cut across the great dining-rooms,
and, when I looked up at him,
his eyes had filled with tears. He watched
Madame and her husband, a physician,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>going from one child to another, examining
their throats, or their eyes, taking
them out to the little clinic for weighing,
carrying the youngest in their arms,
while the dozen white-uniformed young
women hurrying up and down the long
rows were ladling the potato-stew and
the rice dessert.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a black-shawled woman,
evidently in deep distress, rushed up the
stairs, and by us to Madame, to pour out
her trouble. She was crying&mdash;she had
run to the cantine, as a child to its
mother, for comfort. Her little eight-year-old
Marie, who had, only a week
ago, been chosen as the loveliest child of
the 1,600 to present the bouquet to the
Minister’s wife, and who, this very morning,
had seemed well and happy, was
lying at home dead of convulsions. The
cantine had been the second home of her
precious one for over two years&mdash;where,
but there, should she flee in her sorrow?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>I turned toward Mr. Hoover, and he
spoke these true words: “The women of

<p class="p110 center">FAREWELL</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">I can</span> think of no more beautiful, final
tribute to the women of Belgium than
that carried in their own words&mdash;words
of tragedy, but words of widest
vision and understanding and generosity,
sent in farewell to us:</p>

<p>“Oh, you who are going back in that
free country of the United States, tell to
all our sufferings, our distress; tell them
again and again our cries of alarm, which
come from our opprest and agonized
hearts! You have lived and felt what
we are living and feeling; we have understood
that, higher than charity which
gives, you brought us charity which understands
and consoles! Your souls have
bowed down over ours, our eyes with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>anxiety are looking in your friendly eyes.
Over the big ocean our wishes follow you.
Oh, might you there remember the little
Belgium! The life which palpitates in
her grateful heart&mdash;she owes it to you!
<em>You are our hope, our anchor! Help us!
Do not abandon the work of charity you
have undertaken!</em></p>

<p>“Our endless gratitude goes to you,
and from father to children, in the hovel
and in the palace, we shall repeat your
great heart, your high idealism, <em>your
touching charity</em>!”</p>

<p>NOTE BY THE AUTHOR</p>

<p>The increase in dependency in less than
a year, as shown by a comparison of the
following figures with those in this book,
suggests more poignantly than any written
account could, the daily deepening tragedy
of Belgium:</p>

  <td class="cht">Present total on “Soupes” in whole of Belgium</td>
  <td class="right"> 3,032,089</td>
